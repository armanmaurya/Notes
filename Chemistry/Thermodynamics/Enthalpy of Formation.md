# Enthalpy of Formation
The amount of heat evolved or absorbed when one [Mole](../Mole%20Concept/Mole.md) of a substance is formed from its constituent elements is called heat of formation.
$$
H_{2}(g) + Cl_{2}(g) \to 2HCl(g); \ \Delta H =-44\text{kcal}
$$
Thus, enthalpy of formation of $HCl$ is $-22 \text{kcal}$.
