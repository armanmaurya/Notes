# Enthalpy of Reaction
It is define as the amount of heat evolved or absorbed when the reacting species, as represented by a balanced chemical equation have completely reacted.

Enthalpy or heat of reaction is given by 
$$
\Delta H = \Sigma H_{f(p)}- \Sigma H_{f(R)}
$$
Or,
$$
\Delta H = \text{formation enthalpy of products}- \text{formation enthalpy of reactants}
$$
**> Example:-**
If a balanced chemical equation is $2A + 3B \to 4C$, then find the $\Delta H$.
$$
\Delta H = 4H_{f(c)}- (2H_{f(A)} + 3H_{f(B)})
$$
