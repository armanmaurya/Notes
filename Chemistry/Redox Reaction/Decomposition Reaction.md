This is the kind of [Redox Reaction](Redox%20Reaction.md)which involves the breakdown of a compound into different compounds. Example of these types of reaction are-
- $2NaH\to 2Na + H_{2}$
- $2H_{2}O\to 2H_{2} + O_{2}$
- $Na_{2}CO_{3}\to Na_{2}O + CO_{2}$
All the above reaction result in the breakdown of smaller chemical compound in the form of AB -> A + B.

But, there is a special case that confirms that all the decomposition reactions are not [Redox Reaction](Redox%20Reaction.md)
