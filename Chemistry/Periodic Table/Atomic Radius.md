Distance between center of nucleus to outermost electron.

Accurate Value of atomic radius cannot be measured therefore operational definations are used.
1. Covalent radius
2. Metalic radius
3. Vander Waal's radius

$$r_{\text{cov}} < r_{\text{metalic}} < r_{\text{vw}}$$
Vander wall radius mainly used for noble gases.

### Factors Affecting atomic radius
1. AR $\propto$ Number of shells
2. AR $\propto$ $\cfrac{1}{Z_{eff}}$

### Periodic trends
1. Generally increases on moving down the group
2. Generally decreases when we are moving left to right in the period.
   **<u>Note:</u>**
   Atomic radius of $Al > Ga$ : Due to poor sheilding of $3d$ subshell electron
   Atomic radius of $4d \sim 5d$ series elements due to [[lanthanide constraction.]] (also [[actinide contraction]])
