1 mole of substance is defined as that much amount of substance, which contain as many particle as there are no. Of atoms in 12 gm Sample of C-12 Isotopes that is $6.023 \times 10^{23}$.
- Mole is a unit
- Mole is a unit in chemistry to measure no. Of Subatomic Particle's
- Always molecule (compound, atom, Element) are expressed in mole.
- Always mention you are calculating moles of atom/molecule /electron/proton/neutron.

For me Mole is just a number-
$$
1 \text{ Mole} = 6.023\times 10^{23}= N_{A}
$$
But What it is now and when

# Calculate No. Of Moles
To calculation No. Of [moles](Jee/Chemistry/Mole%20Concept/Mole.md) for any substance other than gas below is the formula :
$$
\text{No. of moles} = \frac{\text{weight of substance (g)}}{\text{Atomic or Molecular weight}}
$$
