- Proceed in both directions, forward as well as backward
- Also known as bi-directional chemical reactions.
- Concentration of reactants will not be zero at any point of time.
- Take infinite time to get completed.
- Equilibrium is defined for these types of reactions.

**Example:-** 
1. Gaseous Reaction in closed container: $$N_{2}(g) + 3H_{2}(g) \leftrightharpoons 2NH_{3}(g)$$
2. Ionization of Weak Acid and Weak Base: $$NH_{4}OH \leftrightharpoons NH_{4}^+ + OH^-$$ $$CH_{3}COOH \leftrightharpoons CH_{3}COO^- + H^+$$
3. Neutralisation of (Strong Acid + Weak Base), (Weak Acid + Strong Base), (Weak Acid + Weak Base)
