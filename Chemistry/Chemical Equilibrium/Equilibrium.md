Equilibrium represents the state of a [system](../Thermodynamics/System%20And%20Surroundings.md)  in which the properties of system do not change with time such as pressure, temperature, velocity, acceleration, etc.
Any system which attain equilibrium, two opposite processes are involved. Equilibrium is attained when the rate of these opposite processes become equal.
