# Coordination Compound
---
Those compound which retain their identity even when dissolved in water or any other solvent and their properties are completely different from constituent ions.
## Properties 
The general properties of coordination compounds are:-
-   The coordination compounds formed by the transition elements are coloured due to the presence of unpaired electrons that absorb light in their electronic transitions. For example, the complexes containing [Iron(II)](https://byjus.com/iron-ii-oxide-formula/) can exhibit green and pale green colours, but the coordination compounds containing iron (III) have a brown or yellowish-brown colour.
-   When the coordination centre (central atom) is a metal, the corresponding coordination complexes have a magnetic nature due to the presence of unpaired electrons.
-   Coordination compounds exhibit a variety of [chemical reactivity](https://byjus.com/chemistry/reactivity-series/). They can be a part of inner-sphere electron transfer reactions as well as outer-sphere electron transfers.
-   Complex compounds with certain ligands have the ability to aid in the transformation of molecules in a catalytic or stoichiometric manner.
## Some Important Terms
### Coordination entity
A coordination Entity constitutes a central metal atom or ion bonded to a fixed number of ions or molecules. For example. []

### Ligand
The ions or molecules bound to the central atom/ion in the coordination entity are called ligands. These may be simple ions such as $Cl^-$, small molecules such as $H_{2}O \text{ or } NH_{3}$, larger molecules such as $H_{2}NCH_{2}CH_{2}NH_{2}$ (ethane-1,2-diamine). **Ligand act as $e^-$ pair donor** (lewis base), $[Fe(CN)_{6}]$ -Ligand (Lewis base)

The no. Of $e^-$ pair donated to central metal atom by particular ligand is known denticity. ([Here is details](Jee/Chemistry/Coordination%20Compounds/Coordination%20Compound.pdf#page=4&selection=142,0,233,54))
1. **Unidentate**: When a ligand bound to a metal ion through a single donor atom, as with $Cl^-$, $H_{2}O$ or $NH_{3}$ 
2. **Didentate:** When a ligand can bind through two donor atoms as in $H_{2}NCH_{2}CH_{2}NH_{2}$ (ethane-1,2-diamine) or $C_{2}O_{4}^{2-}$ (oxalate)
3. **Polydentate:** When several donor atoms are present in a single ligand as in $N (CH_{2}CH_{2}NH_{2})_{3}$, Ethylenediaminetetraacetate ion (EDTA $^{4-}$) is an important hexadentate or polydentate ligand. It can bind through two nitrogen and four oxygen atoms to a central metal ion. 


### Coordination number
   The coordination number of a metal ion in a complex can be defined as the number of ligand donor atoms to which the metal is directly bonded. For example, in the complex ions, $[PtCl_{6}]^{2-}$ and $[Ni(NH_{3})_{4}^{2+}]$, the coordination number of $Pt$ and $Ni$ are 6 and 4 respectively. 
   
   It is important to note here that coordination number of the central atom/ion is determined only by the number of sigma bonds formed by the ligand with the central atom/ion. Pi bonds, if formed between the ligand and the central atom/ion, are not counted for this purpose.([here](Jee/Chemistry/Coordination%20Compounds/Coordination%20Compound.pdf#page=4&selection=285,0,287,49))
### Central Metal Atom or Ion
---
The atom or ion to which one or more Central molecules or ions are attached is central atom/ion central atom or ion accepts lone pair so it should have vacant orbitals
##### Must Have Properties
1. **Must** have Vacant Orbital
2. $Z_{eff}$ should be larger.
3. Size must be small and Charge should be large.
4. Most of the time central atom are from d & f block elements and sometimes rarely $Be^{+2}, Mg^{+2}, Ca^{+2}$.
As you can observe from periodic table Group-1, they have +1 charge and it is smallest but they have maximum size in their period. So they can't be central atom.
### Complex Ion
---
Central Metal Atom + Ligand
### Coordination sphere
$K_{4}[Fe(CN)_{6}] \rightarrow$ Everything inside the Square Brackets ([]) are know as Coordination sphere.
