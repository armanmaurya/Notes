**Question** 
Find the Linkage Isomerism of $[Co(NO_{2})_{3}(CN)_{3}]^{-3}$ ?

**Solution**:
As you solve the Question by following P&C method then it will be very lengthy Question is chances of mistake will increase 
So, we will use shortcut method to find the Linkage Isomers
$$
\text{Total Isomers} = (n_{1}+1)(n_{2}+1)(n_{3}+1)\dots
$$
$n_{1}$ = No. Of first type of ambidentate ligand.
$n_{2}$ = No. Of Second type of ambidentate ligand.
So, Total Isomers will be:
$$
\text{Total Isomers} = (3+1)(3+1) = 16 
$$
16 will be the Total Isomers
