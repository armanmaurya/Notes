Some liquids on mixing form azeotropes which are binary mixture having some composition in liquid and vapour phase and boil at constant temperature. Azerotropic [mixture](Mixture.md) cannot be seperated by fractional distillation. 

# Types of Azerotropic mixtures
1. **Minimum boiling Azerotropic mixtures**
   
   The mixture of two liquids whose boiling point is less than either of the two pure components. They are formed by non-ideal [Solution](Solution.md) showing positive deviation. For example (95.5%) + water (4.5%) + water boils at 351.15 K.
1. **Maximum boiling Azerotropic mixtures**
   
   The [mixture](Mixture.md) of two liquids whose boiling point are more than either of the two pure components. They are formed by non-ideal [solution](Solution.md) showing negative deviation. For example $HNO_{3}$ (68%) + water (32%) mixture boils at 393.5 K.
