Colligative Properties are physical properties of [solution](Jee/Chemistry/Solution/Solution.md), which **depends only on no. of [solute](Jee/Chemistry/Solution/Solute.md) particle** present in a [solution](Jee/Chemistry/Solution/Solution.md) not on the nature of [solute](Jee/Chemistry/Solution/Solute.md) particle.
$$
\text{Colligative Property} \propto \text{no. of solute particle in solution}
$$
There are 4 Colligative Properties are-
1. [Osmotic Pressure](Jee/Chemistry/Solution/Colligative%20Properties/Osmotic%20Pressure/Osmotic%20Pressure.md) 
2. [Relative Lowering Of Vapour Pressure](Jee/Chemistry/Solution/Colligative%20Properties/Relative%20Lowering%20Of%20Vapour%20Pressure/Relative%20Lowering%20Of%20Vapour%20Pressure.md) 
3. [Elevation In Boiling Point](Jee/Chemistry/Solution/Colligative%20Properties/Elevation%20In%20Boiling%20Point.md) 
4. [Depression In Freezing Point](Jee/Chemistry/Solution/Colligative%20Properties/Depression%20In%20Freezing%20Point.md)
