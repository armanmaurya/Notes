Magnitude of minimum pressure which should be applied at high conc. Solution to prevent [Osmosis](../../Osmosis.md).

### Calculating Osmotic Pressure
To calculate Osmotic Pressure below is the formula:-
$$
\Pi = iCRT
$$
Where,
$\Pi$ = Osmotic Pressure (atm).
$i$ = [Van't Hoff factor](../../Van't%20Hoff%20factor.md)
$C$ = [Molarity of Solution](../../Molarity.md) 
$T$ = Temperature.
$R$ = Gas Const = 0.0821
