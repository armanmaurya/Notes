# Vapour Pressure
In closed container at equilibrium when,
$$
\text{Rate of Evaporation} = \text{Rate of Condensation}
$$
Then, pressure exerted by the vapours of the liquid is known as **Vapour Pressure.**

# Vapour Pressure of Pure Solvent
---
[Vapour Pressure](Jee/Chemistry/Solution/Colligative%20Properties/Relative%20Lowering%20Of%20Vapour%20Pressure/Vapour%20Pressure/Vapour%20Pressure.md) of Pure [solvent](Jee/Chemistry/Solution/Solvent.md) or liquid is constant at particular temperature.
$$
P_{A}^o = \text{Const Value} = \text{V.P of Pure liq. A at particular temperature}
$$

# Vapour Pressure of Liquid-Liquid Solution 
---
If the [solute](Jee/Chemistry/Solution/Solute.md)  and [solvent](Jee/Chemistry/Solution/Solvent.md) both are liquid then the, Sum of partial vapour pressure of liquid A & B  in [Solution](Jee/Chemistry/Solution/Solution.md) is the [Vapour Pressure](Jee/Chemistry/Solution/Colligative%20Properties/Relative%20Lowering%20Of%20Vapour%20Pressure/Vapour%20Pressure/Vapour%20Pressure.md) of [Solution](Jee/Chemistry/Solution/Solution.md). 

# Relative Lowering of Vapour Pressure
It isÂ the difference between the [Vapour Pressure](Jee/Chemistry/Solution/Colligative%20Properties/Relative%20Lowering%20Of%20Vapour%20Pressure/Vapour%20Pressure/Vapour%20Pressure.md) of a pure [solvent](Jee/Chemistry/Solution/Solvent.md)  and the [Vapour Pressure](Jee/Chemistry/Solution/Colligative%20Properties/Relative%20Lowering%20Of%20Vapour%20Pressure/Vapour%20Pressure/Vapour%20Pressure.md) of a [solution](Jee/Chemistry/Solution/Solution.md).
