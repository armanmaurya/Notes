Electrolysis is a process in which [Non-Spontaneous ](Non-Spontaneous%20Reaction.md)   [Redox Reaction](../Redox%20Reaction/Redox%20Reaction.md) is carried out at the Expense of Electrical Energy.
During Electrolysis electron lost during [Oxidation](Oxidation.md) is Equal to electron gain during [Reduction](Reduction.md).
