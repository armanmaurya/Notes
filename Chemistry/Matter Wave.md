As light is behaving like particle, so De-brogley thought that particle can also behave like wave, then wavelength of matter wave is given by:
$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{P}
$$
Where:
- $h$ is plank's constant 
- $P$ is momentum

Momentum $P$ is also be derived in the form of kinetic energy ($K.E$) then wavelength is given by:
$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{ 2m(K.E) }}
$$
Where:
- $m$ is the mass of matter

When $q$ charge is accelerating with V Potential difference wavelength of that charge is given by:
$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{ 2mqV }}
$$
So, For electron wave length is given by: 
$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{ 2meV }} = \sqrt{ \frac{150}{V} }  \text{ Å}
$$
Where:
- $e$ is the charge on electron
- $m$ is the mass of electron

##### Summary:-
$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{P} = \frac{h}{\sqrt{ 2m(K.E) }} = \frac{h}{\sqrt{ 2mqV }}
$$
For electron:
$$
\lambda = \sqrt{ \frac{150}{V} } \ Å
$$
