The phenomenon in which two or more structures can be written for the true structure of a molecule, but none of them can be said to represent it uniquely, is referred to as resonance or mesomerism. The true structure of the molecule is said to be resonance hybrid of the various possible alternative structure which themselves are known as resonating structure or cononical structures.

**Necessary condition for resonance:**
- All the resonating structure must have the same arrangement of atomic nuclei.
- The resonating structures must have the same number of paired and unpaired electrons. However, they differ in the way of distribution of electrons.
- The energies of the various limiting structures must be same or nearly the same.
- Resonating structures must be planar.
