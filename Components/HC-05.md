The HC-05 is a popular Bluetooth module used for establishing wireless communication between devices, such as microcontrollers (like [Arduino](../Arduino.md)) and computers or smartphones. It operates using the Bluetooth Serial Port Protocol (SPP), making it suitable for data transmission over short distances (typically up to 10 meters).

### 2. **Key Features of HC-05**

- **Bluetooth Version**: HC-05 supports Bluetooth 2.0, which is widely compatible with many devices.
- **Transmission Range**: Generally up to 10 meters (33 feet) in open space.
- **Operating Voltage**: 3.3 V to 6 V (can be powered directly from Arduino).
- **Data Rate**: Typically 9600 bps (baud rate), configurable.
- **Profiles Supported**: Supports SPP for serial communication.
- **LED Indicators**: Two LEDs for indicating power and Bluetooth status.

### 3. **Pin Configuration**

The HC-05 module has several pins that allow it to connect with other devices. The typical pinout is as follows:

| Pin Name  | Description                                  |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| VCC       | Power supply (3.3 V - 6 V)                    |
| GND       | Ground                                       |
| TXD       | Transmit pin (sends data to Arduino)        |
| RXD       | Receive pin (receives data from Arduino)    |
| STATE     | Bluetooth connection status                  |
| EN        | Enable pin (for AT command mode)            |

### 4. **Connecting HC-05 to Arduino**

**Wiring Diagram**:

```
HC-05      |    Arduino
-------------------------
VCC        |    5V
GND        |    GND
TXD        |    RX (Pin 0)
RXD        |    TX (Pin 1)
```

**Connection Notes**:
- **Power Supply**: Connect the VCC pin of HC-05 to the 5 V pin on Arduino.
- **TXD/RXD Connections**: Ensure correct wiring between TXD and RXD pins. The TXD pin of HC-05 should connect to the RX pin of Arduino, and the RXD pin of HC-05 should connect to the TX pin of Arduino. If you're using a 5 V Arduino, you may need a voltage divider for the RXD pin to prevent damage to the HC-05.

### 5. **Configuring the HC-05 Module**

The HC-05 can be configured to change its settings, such as the baud rate and device name, using AT commands. To enter AT command mode, follow these steps:

1. **Connect the HC-05 Module**: Use the above wiring diagram.
2. **Enter AT Mode**:
   - Pull the EN pin HIGH (3.3 V) before powering the module. This can usually be done by connecting it to a digital pin on Arduino and setting it HIGH in the setup function.
3. **Open Serial Monitor**: Use a serial terminal (like the Arduino Serial Monitor) to send AT commands to the HC-05.

**Common AT Commands**:

- **Check Version**:  
  Command: `AT`  
  Response: `OK`

- **Change Baud Rate**:  
  Command: `AT+UART=9600,0,0`  
  This sets the baud rate to 9600 bps.

- **Change Device Name**:  
  Command: `AT+NAME=NewName`  
  This changes the Bluetooth name to "NewName".

- **Check Current Name**:  
  Command: `AT+NAME?`  
  Response: `+NAME:YourDeviceName`

- **Set Password**:  
  Command: `AT+PIN=1234`  
  Sets the pairing code to "1234".

### 6. **Establishing a Connection**

1. **Pairing**:
   - Make sure the HC-05 is powered on and in discoverable mode. Use a laptop or smartphone to search for Bluetooth devices and select the HC-05 module.
   - Enter the pairing code (usually `1234` or `0000`) to connect.

2. **Using Serial Communication**:
   - Once paired, use the Serial library in Arduino to communicate with the HC-05 module.

**Example Arduino Code**:
```cpp
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);  // Initialize serial communication
  Serial.println("HC-05 is ready to receive data");
}

void loop() {
  if (Serial.available()) {
    String data = Serial.readStringUntil('\n');
    Serial.print("Received: ");
    Serial.println(data);
  }
}
```

### 7. **Applications of HC-05**

- **Wireless Data Transmission**: Sending data from microcontrollers to PCs or smartphones.
- **Remote Control Systems**: Controlling devices such as robots or home automation systems via Bluetooth.
- **IoT Projects**: Integrating Bluetooth into Internet of Things applications for data exchange.
- **Wearable Technology**: Communicating with wearable devices and health monitoring systems.

### 8. **Troubleshooting Tips**

- **Connection Issues**: Ensure that the HC-05 is powered and within range of the device itâ€™s connecting to. Check if the module is paired correctly.
- **Baud Rate Mismatch**: Ensure that the baud rate in the Arduino code matches the HC-05 configuration.
- **Serial Monitor**: Make sure the Serial Monitor is set to the correct baud rate (9600) when testing communication.

### Conclusion

The HC-05 Bluetooth module is a versatile and widely used component for wireless communication in various electronic projects. Its ease of use and compatibility with different devices make it an excellent choice for hobbyists and professionals alike. Whether you're building a remote-controlled robot, a smart home application, or an IoT device, the HC-05 can be an integral part of your project.
