The UPnP architecture allows device-to-device networking of [consumer electronics]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_electronics "Consumer electronics"), [mobile]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone "Mobile phone") devices, [personal computers]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer "Personal computer"), and networked [home appliances]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_appliance "Home appliance"). It is a distributed, [open architecture]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_architecture "Open architecture") protocol based on established standards such as the [Internet Protocol Suite]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_Suite "Internet Protocol Suite") (TCP/IP), [HTTP]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP "HTTP"), [XML]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML "XML"), and [SOAP]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP_ (protocol) "SOAP (protocol)"). UPnP _control points_ (CPs) are devices which use UPnP protocols to control UPnP _controlled devices_ (CDs).<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>

The UPnP architecture supports zero-configuration networking. A UPnP-compatible device from any vendor can dynamically join a network, obtain an IP address, announce its name, advertise or convey its capabilities upon request, and learn about the presence and capabilities of other devices. [Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol") (DHCP) and [Domain Name System]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System "Domain Name System") (DNS) servers are optional and are only used if they are available on the network. Devices can disconnect from the network automatically without leaving [state]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_ (computer_science) "State (computer science)") information.

UPnP was published as a 73-part [international standard]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_standard "International standard"), ISO/IEC 29341, in December 2008
Other UPnP features include:

**Media and device independence**
	UPnP technology can run on many media that support IP including [Ethernet]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet"), [FireWire]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FireWire "FireWire"), IR ([IrDA]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IrDA "IrDA")), home wiring ([G.hn]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.hn "G.hn")) and RF ([Bluetooth]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth "Bluetooth"), [Wi-Fi]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi "Wi-Fi")). No special [device driver]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver "Device driver") support is necessary; common network protocols are used instead.
	

[User interface]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface "User interface") (UI) Control

_Optionally_, the UPnP architecture enables devices to present a user interface through a [web browser]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser") (see [Presentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#Presentation) below).

[Operating system]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") and [programming language]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") independence

Any operating system and any programming language can be used to build UPnP products. UPnP stacks are available for most platforms and operating systems in both closed and open source forms.

Programmatic control

UPnP architecture also enables conventional application programmatic control.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"><span title="needs a definition for &quot;programmatic control&quot; (March 2011)">clarification needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Extensibility

Each UPnP product can have device-specific services layered on top of the basic architecture. In addition to combining services defined by UPnP Forum in various ways, vendors can define their own device and service types, and can extend standard devices and services with vendor-defined actions, state variables, data structure elements, and variable values.

## Protocol\[[edit]( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Protocol")\]

UPnP uses common [Internet]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") technologies. It assumes the network must run [Internet Protocol]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol "Internet Protocol") (IP) and then uses [HTTP]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP "HTTP"), [SOAP]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP "SOAP") and [XML]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML "XML") on top of IP, in order to provide device/service description, actions, data transfer and eventing. Device search requests and advertisements are supported by running HTTP on top of [UDP]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol "User Datagram Protocol") using [multicast]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast "Multicast") (known as HTTPMU). Responses to search requests are also sent over UDP, but are instead sent using [unicast]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicast "Unicast") (known as HTTPU). UPnP uses UDP due to its lower overhead in not requiring confirmation of received data and retransmission of corrupt packets. HTTPU and HTTPMU were initially submitted as an [Internet Draft]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Draft "Internet Draft") but it expired in 2001;<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> these specifications have since been integrated into the actual UPnP specifications.

UPnP uses UDP port 1900 and all used [TCP]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol "Transmission Control Protocol") ports are derived from the SSDP alive and response messages.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

### Addressing\[[edit]( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Addressing")\]

The foundation for UPnP networking is IP addressing. Each device must implement a DHCP client and search for a DHCP server when the device is first connected to the network. If no DHCP server is available, the device must assign itself an address. The process by which a UPnP device assigns itself an address is known within the UPnP Device Architecture as [AutoIP]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoIP "AutoIP"). In UPnP Device Architecture Version 1.0,<sup id="cite_ref-uda-v1.0_3-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-uda-v1.0-3">[3]</a></sup> AutoIP is defined within the specification itself; in UPnP Device Architecture Version 1.1,<sup id="cite_ref-uda-v1.1_4-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-uda-v1.1-4">[4]</a></sup> AutoIP references [IETF]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force "Internet Engineering Task Force") RFC 3927. If during the DHCP transaction, the device obtains a domain name, for example, through a DNS server or via [DNS forwarding]( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DNS_forwarding&action=edit&redlink=1 "DNS forwarding (page does not exist)"), the device should use that name in subsequent network operations; otherwise, the device should use its IP address.

### Discovery\[[edit]( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Discovery")\]

Once a device has established an IP address, the next step in UPnP networking is discovery. The UPnP discovery protocol is known as the [Simple Service Discovery Protocol]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Service_Discovery_Protocol "Simple Service Discovery Protocol") (SSDP). When a device is added to the network, SSDP allows that device to advertise its services to control points on the network. This is achieved by sending SSDP alive messages. When a control point is added to the network, SSDP allows that control point to actively search for devices of interest on the network or listen passively to the SSDP alive messages of devices. The fundamental exchange is a discovery message containing a few essential specifics about the device or one of its services, for example, its type, identifier, and a pointer (network location) to more detailed information.

### Description\[[edit]( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Description")\]

After a control point has discovered a device, the control point still knows very little about the device. For the control point to learn more about the device and its capabilities, or to interact with the device, the control point must retrieve the device's description from the location ([URL]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL "URL")) provided by the device in the discovery message. The UPnP Device Description is expressed in [XML]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML "XML") and includes vendor-specific manufacturer information like the model name and number, [serial number]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_number "Serial number"), manufacturer name, (presentation) URLs to vendor-specific web sites, etc. The description also includes a list of any embedded services. For each service, the Device Description document lists the URLs for control, eventing and service description. Each service description includes a list of the [commands]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_ (computing) "Command (computing)"), or _actions_, to which the service responds, and parameters, or _arguments_, for each action; the description for a service also includes a list of [variables]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_ (programming) "Variable (programming)"); these variables model the state of the service at [run time]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_time_ (program_lifecycle_phase) "Run time (program lifecycle phase)"), and are described in terms of their data type, range, and event characteristics.

### Control\[[edit]( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Control")\]

Having retrieved a description of the device, the control point can send actions to a device's service. To do this, a control point sends a suitable control message to the control URL for the service (provided in the device description). Control messages are also expressed in XML using the [Simple Object Access Protocol]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP_ (protocol) "SOAP (protocol)") (SOAP). Much like [function calls]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_call "Function call"), the service returns any action-specific values in response to the control message. The effects of the action, if any, are modeled by changes in the variables that describe the run-time state of the service.

### Event notification\[[edit]( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Event notification")\]

Another capability of UPnP networking is [event notification]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_notification "Event notification"), or _eventing_. The event notification protocol defined in the UPnP Device Architecture is known as [General Event Notification Architecture]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Event_Notification_Architecture "General Event Notification Architecture") (GENA). A UPnP description for a service includes a list of actions the service responds to and a list of variables that model the state of the service at run time. The service publishes updates when these variables change, and a control point may subscribe to receive this information. The service publishes updates by sending event messages. Event messages contain the names of one or more state variables and the current value of those variables. These messages are also expressed in XML. A special initial event message is sent when a control point first subscribes; this event message contains the names and values for all _evented_ variables and allows the subscriber to initialize its model of the state of the service. To support scenarios with multiple control points, eventing is designed to keep all control points equally informed about the effects of any action. Therefore, all subscribers are sent all event messages, subscribers receive event messages for all "evented" variables that have changed, and event messages are sent no matter why the state variable changed (either in response to a requested action or because the state the service is modeling changed).

### Presentation\[[edit]( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Presentation")\]

The final step in UPnP networking is presentation. If a device has a URL for presentation, then the control point can retrieve a page from this URL, load the page into a [web browser]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser"), and depending on the capabilities of the page, allow a user to control the device and/or view device status. The degree to which each of these can be accomplished depends on the specific capabilities of the presentation page and device.

## AV standards\[[edit]( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: AV standards")\]

_UPnP AV architecture_ is an audio and video extension of the UPnP, supporting a variety of devices such as TVs, VCRs, CD/DVD players/jukeboxes, settop boxes, stereos systems, MP 3 players, still image cameras, camcorders, electronic picture frames (EPFs), and personal computers. The UPnP AV architecture allows devices to support different types of formats for the entertainment content, including MPEG 2, MPEG 4, JPEG, MP 3, Windows Media Audio (WMA), bitmaps (BMP), and NTSC, PAL or ATSC formats. Multiple types of transfer protocols are supported, including IEEE 1394, HTTP, RTP and TCP/IP.<sup id="cite_ref-UPnP-av-AVArchitecture-v2_11-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-UPnP-av-AVArchitecture-v2-11">[11]</a></sup>

On 12 July 2006, the UPnP Forum announced the release of version 2 of the UPnP Audio and Video specifications,<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> with new _MediaServer_ (MS) version 2.0 and _MediaRenderer_ (MR) version 2.0 classes. These enhancements are created by adding capabilities to the MediaServer and MediaRenderer device classes, allowing a higher level of interoperability between products made by different manufacturers. Some of the early devices complying with these standards were marketed by [Philips]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips "Philips") under the [Streamium]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamium "Streamium") brand name.

Since 2006, versions 3 and 4 of the UPnP audio and video device control protocols have been published.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> In March 2013, an updated uPnP AV architecture specification was published, incorporating the updated device control protocols.<sup id="cite_ref-UPnP-av-AVArchitecture-v2_11-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-UPnP-av-AVArchitecture-v2-11">[11]</a></sup> UPnP Device Architecture 2.0 was released in April 2020.

The UPnP AV standards have been referenced in specifications published by other organizations including [Digital Living Network Alliance]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance "Digital Living Network Alliance") Networked Device Interoperability Guidelines,<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> [International Electrotechnical Commission]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission "International Electrotechnical Commission") IEC 62481-1,<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> and [Cable Television Laboratories]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CableLabs "CableLabs") OpenCable Home Networking Protocol.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>

## AV components\[[edit]( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: AV components")\]

Generally a UPnP audio/video (AV) architecture consists of:<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

-   Control Point: a device that discovers Media Servers and Media Renderers, then connects them
-   Media Server: the server that stores content on the network to be accessed by Media Renderers
-   Media Renderer: a device that renders ('plays') content received from a Media Server.

### Media server\[[edit]( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Media server")\]

A **UPnP AV media server** is the UPnP-server ("master" device) that provides media library information and streams media-data (like audio/video/picture/files) to UPnP clients on the network. It is a computer system or a similar digital appliance that stores digital media, such as photographs, movies, or music and shares these with other devices.

UPnP AV media servers provide a service to UPnP AV client devices, so-called _control points_, for browsing the media content of the server and request the media server to deliver a file to the control point for playback.

UPnP media servers are available for most [operating systems]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") and many hardware platforms. UPnP AV media servers can either be categorized as [software]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software "Software")\-based or hardware-based. Software-based UPnP AV media servers can be run on a [PC]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer "Personal computer"). Hardware-based UPnP AV media servers may run on any [NAS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage "Network-attached storage") devices or any specific hardware for delivering media, such as a [DVR]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_video_recorder "Digital video recorder"). As of May 2008, there were more software-based UPnP AV media servers than there were hardware-based servers.

### Other components\[[edit]( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Other components")\]

-   **UPnP MediaServer ControlPoint** - which is the UPnP-client (a 'slave' device) that can auto-detect UPnP-servers on the network to browse and stream media/data-files from them.
-   **UPnP MediaRenderer DCP** - which is a 'slave' device that can render (play) content.
-   **UPnP RenderingControl DCP** - control MediaRenderer settings; volume, brightness, RGB, sharpness, and more.
-   **UPnP Remote User Interface (RUI) client/server** - which sends/receives control-commands between the UPnP-client and UPnP-server over network, (like record, schedule, play, pause, stop, etc.).
    -   **Web 4 CE (CEA 2014) for UPnP Remote UI<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>** - CEA-2014 standard designed by **[Consumer Electronics Association]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Association "Consumer Electronics Association")'s R 7 Home Network Committee**. [Web]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page "Web page")\-based [Protocol]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_ (computing) "Protocol (computing)") and [Framework]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework "Software framework") for Remote User Interface on UPnP [Networks]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_networking "Computer networking") and the [Internet]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") (Web 4 CE). This standard allows a UPnP-capable home network device to provide its [interface]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface "User interface") (display and control options) as a [web page]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page "Web page") to display on any other device connected to the home network. That means that one can control a [home networking]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_networking "Computer networking") device through any [web-browser]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser")\-based communications method for [CE devices]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Association "Consumer Electronics Association") on a UPnP home network using [ethernet]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet") and a special version of [HTML]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML") called [CE-HTML]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CE-HTML "CE-HTML").
-   **QoS (quality of service)** - is an important (but not mandatory) service function for use with UPnP AV (Audio and Video). [QoS (quality of service)]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service "Quality of service") refers to control mechanisms that can provide different priority to different users or data flows, or guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow in accordance with requests from the application program. Since UPnP AV is mostly to deliver [streaming media]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media "Streaming media") that is often [near real-time]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_real-time "Near real-time") or real-time audio/video data which it is critical to be delivered within a specific time or the stream is interrupted. QoS guarantees are especially important if the network capacity is limited, for example public networks, like the [internet]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet").
    -   QoS for UPnP consist of **Sink Device** (client-side/front-end) and **Source Device** (server-side/back-end) service functions. With [classes]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_ (computer_science) "Class (computer science)") such as; **Traffic Class** that indicates the kind of traffic in the traffic stream, (for example, audio or video). **Traffic Identifier (TID)** which identifies data packets as belonging to a unique traffic stream. **Traffic Specification (TSPEC)** which contains a set of parameters that define the characteristics of the traffic stream, (for example operating requirement and scheduling). **Traffic Stream (TS)** which is a unidirectional flow of data that originates at a source device and terminates at one or more sink device (s).
-   **Remote Access** - defines methods for connecting UPnP device sets that are not in the same multicast domain.

## NAT traversal\[[edit]( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: NAT traversal")\]

One solution for [NAT traversal]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT_traversal "NAT traversal"), called the [Internet Gateway Device Protocol]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Gateway_Device_Protocol "Internet Gateway Device Protocol") (UPnP IGD Protocol), is implemented via UPnP. Many [routers]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_ (computing) "Router (computing)") and [firewalls]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_ (computing) "Firewall (computing)") expose themselves as Internet Gateway Devices, allowing any local UPnP control point to perform a variety of actions, including retrieving the external IP address of the device, enumerating existing port mappings, and adding or removing port mappings. By adding a port mapping, a UPnP controller behind the IGD can enable traversal of the IGD from an external address to an internal client.

There are numerous compatibility issues due the different interpretations of the very large actually backward compatible IGDv 1 and IGDv 2 specifications. One of them is the UPnP IGD client integrated with current Microsoft Windows and Xbox systems with certified IGDv 2 routers. The compatibility issue still exist since the introduced of the IGDv 1 client in Windows XP in 2001, and a IGDv 2 router without a workaround that makes router port mapping impossible.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>

If UPnP is only used to control router port mappings and pinholes, there are alternative, newer much simpler and lightweight protocols such as the [PCP]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Control_Protocol "Port Control Protocol") and the [NAT-PMP]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT_Port_Mapping_Protocol "NAT Port Mapping Protocol"), both of which have been standardized as RFCs by the IETF. These alternatives are not yet known to have compatibility issues between different clients and servers, but adoption is still low. For consumer routers, only [AVM]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVM_GmbH "AVM GmbH") and the open source router software projects [OpenWrt]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenWrt "OpenWrt"), [OPNsense]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPNsense "OPNsense"), and [pfSense]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PfSense "PfSense") are currently known to support [PCP]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Control_Protocol "Port Control Protocol") as an alternative to UPnP. [AVM]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVM_GmbH "AVM GmbH")'s [Fritz! Box]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz!Box "Fritz! Box") UPnP IGDv 2 and PCP implementation has been very buggy since its introduction. In many cases it does not work.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-24"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

## Problems\[[edit]( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Problems")\]

### Authentication\[[edit]( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Authentication")\]

The UPnP protocol, by default, does not implement any [authentication]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication "Authentication"), so UPnP device implementations must implement the additional _Device Protection_ service,<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> or implement the _Device Security Service_.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> There also exists a non-standard solution called UPnP-UP (Universal Plug and Play - User Profile)<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-28"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> which proposes an extension to allow user authentication and authorization mechanisms for UPnP devices and applications. Many UPnP device implementations lack authentication mechanisms, and by default assume local systems and their users are completely trustworthy.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>

When the authentication mechanisms are not implemented, [routers]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_ (computing) "Router (computing)") and [firewalls]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_ (computing) "Firewall (computing)") running the UPnP IGD protocol are vulnerable to attack. For example, [Adobe Flash]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash "Adobe Flash") programs running outside the sandbox of the browser (e.g. this requires specific version of Adobe Flash with acknowledged security issues) are capable of generating a specific type of [HTTP]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP "HTTP") request which allows a router implementing the UPnP IGD protocol to be controlled by a malicious web site when someone with a UPnP-enabled router simply visits that web site.<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> This only applies to the ["firewall-hole-punching"-feature of UPnP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#NAT_traversal); it does not apply when the router/firewall does not support UPnP IGD or has been disabled on the router. Also, not all routers can have such things as DNS server settings altered by UPnP because much of the specification (including LAN Host Configuration) is optional for UPnP enabled routers.<sup id="cite_ref-igd-v1.0-v2.0_6-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-igd-v1.0-v2.0-6">[6]</a></sup> As a result, some UPnP devices ship with UPnP turned off by default as a security measure.

### Access from the Internet\[[edit]( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Access from the Internet")\]

In 2011, researcher Daniel Garcia developed a tool designed to exploit a flaw in some UPnP IGD device stacks that allow UPnP requests from the Internet.<sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> The tool was made public at DEFCON 19 and allows portmapping requests to external IP addresses from the device and internal IP addresses behind the NAT. The problem is widely propagated around the world, with scans showing millions of vulnerable devices at a time.<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup>

In January 2013, the security company Rapid 7 in Boston reported<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> on a six-month research programme. A team scanned for signals from UPnP-enabled devices announcing their availability for internet connection. Some 6900 network-aware products from 1500 companies at 81 million IP-addresses responded to their requests. 80% of the devices are home routers; others include printers, webcams and surveillance cameras. Using the UPnP-protocol, many of those devices can be accessed and/or manipulated.

In February 2013, the UPnP forum responded in a press release<sup id="cite_ref-36"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> by recommending more recent versions of the used UPnP stacks, and by improving the certification program to include checks to avoid further such issues.

### IGMP snooping and reliability\[[edit]( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: IGMP snooping and reliability")\]

UPnP is often the only significant multicast application in use in digital home networks; therefore, multicast network misconfiguration or other deficiencies can appear as UPnP issues rather than underlying network issues.

If [IGMP snooping]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGMP_snooping "IGMP snooping") is enabled on a switch, or more commonly a wireless router/switch, it will interfere with UPnP/DLNA device discovery (SSDP) if incorrectly or incompletely configured (e.g. without an active querier or IGMP proxy), making UPnP appear unreliable.

Typical scenarios observed include a server or client (e.g. smart TV) appearing after power on, and then disappearing after a few minutes (often 30 by default configuration) due to IGMP group membership expiring.

### Callback vulnerability\[[edit]( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Callback vulnerability")\]

On 8 June 2020, yet another protocol design flaw was announced.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> Dubbed "CallStranger"<sup id="cite_ref-38"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup> by its discoverer, it allows an attacker to subvert the event subscription mechanism and execute a variety of attacks: amplification of requests for use in DDoS; enumeration; and data exfiltration.

OCF had published a fix to the protocol specification in April 2020,<sup id="cite_ref-39"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> but since many devices running UPnP are not easily upgradable, CallStranger is likely to remain a threat for a long time to come.<sup id="cite_ref-40"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> CallStranger has fueled calls for end-users to abandon UPnP because of repeated failures in security of its design and implementation.<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup>

The UPnP protocols were promoted by the UPnP Forum (formed in October 1999),<sup id="cite_ref-42"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> a computer industry initiative to enable simple and robust connectivity to standalone devices and personal computers from many different vendors. The Forum consisted of more than 800 vendors involved in everything from consumer electronics to network computing. Since 2016, all UPnP efforts have been managed by the [Open Connectivity Foundation]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Connectivity_Foundation "Open Connectivity Foundation") (OCF).

In the fall of 2008, the UPnP Forum ratified the successor to UPnP 1.0 Device Architecture, UPnP 1.1.<sup id="cite_ref-43"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> The [Devices Profile for Web Services]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devices_Profile_for_Web_Services "Devices Profile for Web Services") (DPWS) standard was a candidate successor to UPnP, but UPnP 1.1 was selected by the UPnP Forum. Version 2 of IGD is standardized.<sup id="cite_ref-44"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup>

The UPnP Internet Gateway Device (IGD)<sup id="cite_ref-igd-v1.0-v2.0_6-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-igd-v1.0-v2.0-6">[6]</a></sup> standard has a WANIPConnection service, which provides similar functionality to [IETF]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF "IETF")\-standard [Port Control Protocol]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Control_Protocol "Port Control Protocol"). The [NAT-PMP]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT-PMP "NAT-PMP") specification contains a list of the problems with IGDP <sup id="cite_ref-rfc-6886_45-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-rfc-6886-45">[45]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 26–32">: 26–32 </span></sup>  that prompted the creation of NAT-PMP and its successor PCP.

### Additional UPnP device standards\[[edit]( https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Additional UPnP device standards")\]

A number of further standards have been defined for the UPnP Device Architecture:

-   The [Wi-Fi Alliance]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Alliance "Wi-Fi Alliance") defines a set of "WFA device" (`urn: schemas-wifialliance-org:device:WFADevice`) services related to the wireless access point.
    -   The WFAWLANConfig service is a required part and defines ways to query the capabilities of a wireless access point and set up wireless connections.<sup id="cite_ref-46"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup> This service is used in the AP-ER and UPnP-C types of [Wi-Fi Protected Setup]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup "Wi-Fi Protected Setup").<sup id="cite_ref-47"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup>
