It is a function that repeats its values at regular intervals or periods. The repeatable part of the function is called **cycle**. They are used throughout science to describe oscillations, waves and other phenomena that exhibit periodicity.
A function $f$ is said to be periodic if, for some nonzero constant $P$, it is the case that $$f(x+P) = f(x)$$ for all values of x in the domain. This nonzero constant $P$ is called period of the function.

#### Examples 
---
The sine function is periodic with period $2\pi$, since $$\sin(x+2\pi) = \sin x$$
