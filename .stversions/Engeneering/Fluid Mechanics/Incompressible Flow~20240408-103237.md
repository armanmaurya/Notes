The compressibility of a medium becomes important when the speed of a body begins to approach the speed of sound in the medium. At the speeds much lower than the speed of sound the disturbance created by a body pushing aside the fluid is too small to significantly change the thermal energy of the fluid and fluid behaves as if it is incompressible $\rho = \text{constant}$.

# Imp Points
---
- If Mach number (M) < 0.3 then it is a Incompressible flow.
