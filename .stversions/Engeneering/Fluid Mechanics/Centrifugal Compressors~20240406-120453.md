A Centrifugal Compressor is a type of dynamic compressor used to **increase the pressure of gas** by converting its kinetic energy into potential energy.
# Essential Parts:-
The compression process is carried out in a centrifugal compressor, which comprises mainly of four element are:-
1. The *inlet casing with converging nozzle* whose function is to accelerate the fluid to the impeller inlet. The outlet of the inlet casing is known as the eye.
2. The *impeller*, in which the energy transfer takes place, resulting in rise of fluid kinetic energy and static pressure.
3. The *diffuser* whose function is to transform the high kinetic energy of the fluid at the *impeller* outlet into static pressure.
4. The *outlet casing*, which comprises a fluid collector know as a volute or scroll.

# Velocity Triangles & Blade Shape
---
In order to understand the actual energy transfer and flow through the compressor, we will use two velocity triangle, viz., entry velocity triangle and exit velocity triangle. The notification used here correspond to the $x, r, \theta$ coordinate system. As per the convention for radial machines, at a given point the angles are measured from the tangential direction. The absolute and relative air angles at the entry and exit of the impeller are denoted by $\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2} \text{ and } \beta_{1}, \beta_{2}$ respectively. 

Based on the value of $\beta_{2}$ the blade shapes are given the name as:-
- Forward Curved Blades ($\beta_{2}>90^o$)
- Radial Blades ($\beta_{2}=90^o$) 
- Backward Curved Blades ($\beta_{2}<90^o$)

> Note that angle $\beta_{2}$ is measured with respect to negative of $u$ (i.e., $-u$). 

The impeller linear velocity at inlet and exit are given by,
$$
u_{1} = \frac{2\pi r_{1}N}{60}
$$
$$
u_{2} = \frac{2\pi r_{1}N}{60}
$$

# Design 
---
Usually the **pressure ratio** required and the **mass flow** are specified to the designer. The **ambient temperature** and **pressure range** in which the machine is to operate are also known.
For example, a jet engine has to operate at sea-level as well as at varying altitudes. The application to which it is going to be put decides the speed of rotation. If compressor is coupled to an alternator or d.c machine, its speed is exactly known. Even i other applications a rough idea of rotational speed is always available. 
In addition to this rough idea of adiabatic efficiency of the compressor, the blade pressure coefficients, the inlet velocity at the impeller and the compressor outlet velocity is always available.
The compressor outlet velocity is limited by the type of combustion chamber used in the gas turbine, and by the fact that if compressor is directly connected to combustion chamber or through a head exchanger. In the first case low compressor outlet velocity
