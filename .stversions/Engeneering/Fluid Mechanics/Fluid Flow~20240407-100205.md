Fluid flow is generally the motion of fluid that is subjected to different unbalance force.

# Compressible Flow
---
Compressibility is the fractional change in volume of the fluid element per unit change in pressure.

Flow is said to be compressible flow if its mach number (M) is > 0.3 else, it is incompressible flow.
- M < 0.3 -- Subsonic & imcompressible
- 0.3 < M < 0.8 -- Subsonic & compre

Significant changes in velocity and presure result in density variations throughout a flow field.

Large Temperature variations results in density variations.
