Fluid flow is generally the motion of fluid that is subjected to different unbalance force.

# Compressible Flow
---
Compressibility is the fractional change in volume of the fluid element per unit change in pressure.

Flow is said to be compressible flow if its mach number is > 0.3 else, it is incompressible flow.

Significant changes in velocity and presure result in density variations throughout a flow field.

Large Temperature variations results in density variations.
