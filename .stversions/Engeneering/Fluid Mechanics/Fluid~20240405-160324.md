**Definition:** It has ability to flow under shear force.
- For a **Static fluid** Shear Force = 0, But Pressure/Viscosity/Surface Tension $\ne$ 0
- For **Ideal Fluid** is Incomprehensible, Non-Viscous, No Surface Tension, Bulk Modules is Infinity.
- For **Real Fluid** is Viscous, Compressible and Surface Tension exist, Finite Bulk Modulus.
