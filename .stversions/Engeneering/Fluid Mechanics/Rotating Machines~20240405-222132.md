Rotating machines work on the principle of work addition or extraction. When a fluid passes through a rotating machines two things happen, viz., **Energy transfer** and **Energy transformation**. The **Energy transfer** means transfer of available energy from one part (rotor) to the medium (fluid) or vice versa.  **Energy transformation** means change of one form of energy to another form, for example, *change of kinetic energy to pressure energy in compressor.* **The energy transfer can occur only in its moving or rotating elements whereas the energy transformation can can occur in both stationary and rotating elements.**
