Compressibility is the fractional change in volume of the fluid element per unit change in pressure.

Flow is said to be compressible flow if its mach number (M) is > 0.3 else, it is incompressible flow.
- M < 0.3 -- Subsonic & imcompressible
- 0.3 < M < 0.8 -- Subsonic & compressible 
- 0.8 < M < 1.2 -- transonic flow
- 

Significant changes in velocity and presure result in density variations throughout a flow field.

Large Temperature variations results in density variations.

# Approach 
---
- Control volume approach 
- Steady, One-dimension, Uniform Flow
- Additional Thermodynamics Concepts are needed
- Restrict out analysis to ideal gases
