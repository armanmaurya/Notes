Once capacitor is fully charged then they block the DC current and allow AC current to flow properly. Means act as open wire for dc current and close wire for AC current.

# Energy Store by Capacitors
$$
U = \frac{1}{2}CV^2 = \frac{q^2}{2C} = \frac{qV}{2}
$$
Where,
- V $\to$ Potential | Potential difference (Voltage)
- q $\to$ Charge
