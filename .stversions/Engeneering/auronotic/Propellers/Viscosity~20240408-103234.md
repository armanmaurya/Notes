This is a measure of the resistance of one layer of air to movement over the neighbouring layer; it is rather similar to the property of friction between solids. Viscosity is possessed to a large degree by fluids such as treacle and certain oils, and although the property is much less noticeable in air, it is none the less of considerable importance.
