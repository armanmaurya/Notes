Viscosity is the property which resists the shearing motion of two adjacent layer of the fluid.

A fluid is know as a Newtonian fluid if the relation between the shear stress and the angular deformations is linear. The shear stress is given by,
$$
\tau \propto \frac{dc}{dy} = \mu\frac{dc}{dy}
$$
The constant of proportionality, $\mu$, is known as the coefficient of viscosity or dynamic viscosity.

The kinematic viscosity, $v$, is the ratio of the dynamic viscosity and the density of the fluid.
$$
v = \frac{\mu}{\rho}
$$
All real flows experience fluid viscosity. Therefore, their behaviour is influenced by the viscous forces.
