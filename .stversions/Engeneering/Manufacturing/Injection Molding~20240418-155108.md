Injection Molding is a manufacturing process for producing parts by injecting molten material into a mould or mold. Injection moulding can be performed with a host of material mainly including metals, glasses, elastomers, confections, and most commonly thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers. Material for the part is fed into a heated barrel, mixed (using a helical screw), and injected into a mould cavity, where it cools and hardens to the configuration.![](../../330px-Rocker_bogie.gif)
