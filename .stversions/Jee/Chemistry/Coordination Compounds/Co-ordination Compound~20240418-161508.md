# Complex or Coordination Compound
Those compound which retain their identity even when dissolved in water or any other solvent and their properties are completely different from constituent ions.
### Central Metal Atom or Ion
---
The atom or ion to which one or more Central molecules or ions are attached is central atom/ion central atom or ion accepts lone pair so it should have vacant orbitals
##### Must Have Properties 
1. **Must** have Vacant Orbital
2. $Z_{eff}$ should be larger.
3. Size must be small and Charge should be large.
4. Most of the time central atom are from d & f block elements and sometimes rarely $Be^{+2}, Mg^{+2}, Ca^{+2}$.
As you can observe from periodic table Group-1, they have +1 charge and it is smallest but they have maximum size in their period. So they can't be central atom.
### Complex Ion
---
Central Metal Atom + Ligand
### Coordination sphere
$K_{4}[Fe(CN)_{6}] \rightarrow$ Everything inside the Square Brackets ([]) are know as Coordination sphere.
# Ligand:
The ion or neutral molecule which combine with central metal ion to form complex are called ligand. **Ligand act as $e^-$ pair donor** (lewis base)
$[Fe(CN)_{6}]$
Ligand (Lewis base)
#### Classification of ligands
1. On the basis of bond b/w CMA and Ligand
2. On the basis of charge
3. On the basis of denticity.
##### 1. On the basis of bond b/w CMA and Ligand 
**A. Classical Ligand**
That ligand which simply donates the lone pair to CMA.

 **B. $\pi$ -acid Ligand/ $\pi$ acceptor**
 Ligands that are able to accept electron density from the metal atom into its own empty or * orbital
##### 2. On the basis of Charge
**A. Cationic:**
Those Ligand which have positive charge.
This case is not very common because these ligand already have a positive charge and then donating line pair to CMA.

**B. Anionic**
Those Ligand which have negative charge.

**C. Neutral Ligand:**
Those Ligand which are neutral. But still they donate $e^-$.
##### 3. On the basis of denticity
The no. Of $e^-$ pair donated to central metal atom by particular ligand is known denticity.
All positive, negative, neutral Ligand come somewhere in this type of Ligand.
1 $e^-$ pair donated = Monodentate
2 $e^-$ pair donated = Bidentate
3 $e^-$ pair donated = Tridentate
4 or more $e^-$ pair donated = polydentate
