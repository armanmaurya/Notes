The path traced by a moving point under the given geometrical condition is knows as locus of that point.

### Equation of Locus:
The equation of a locus is the relation which exists between the coordinates of any point on the path, and which holds for no other point except those lying on the path.

**Steps to find the equation of LOCUS:-**
1. If we are finding the equation of the locus of a point $P$, let $P$ be $(h,k)$.
2. Apply the given **geometrical conditions.**
3. **Get the relation between $h$ and $k$** by eleminating the variable assumed (if any.)
4. Replace $(h,k)\to(x,y)$. The resulting equation would be the equation of the locus of $P$
