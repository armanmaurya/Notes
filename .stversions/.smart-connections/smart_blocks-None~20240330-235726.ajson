The binary digit one is represented by 5V or HIGH logic. Conversely, binary zero is denoted with a logic LOW or zero volts. In order to implement serial commutation, a source and destination are required. They are also referred to as the sender and receiver. Various types of serial commutation can be employed and are designated as [Simplex](Simplex.md), [Half Duplex](Half%20Duplex.md) and [Full Duplex](Full%20Duplex.md).\n\nSerial communication conducts the data transmission on a bit by bit basis.

Compound Generators:\nThe drooping characteristic of a shunt generator and the rising characteristic of a series generator provide us enough motivation to theorize the possibility of a better external characteristic by fusing the two generators into one. In fact, under certain constraints, putting the two generators together is like transforming two contentiously different generators into a single well-behaved generator. This is done by winding both series and shunt field windings on each pole of the generator. When the mmf of the series field is aiding the mmf of the shunt field, it is referred to as a cumulative compound generator (Figure 5.29a). Otherwise, it is termed a differential compound generator (Figure 5.29b).\nWhen the shunt field winding is connected directly across the armature terminals, it is called a short-shunt generator.

For example, to perform automated bin picking, a robotic arm used in a manufacturing machines. The grasping end of a robot arm is designated as the end-effector. The robot configuration is a list of joint positions that are within the position limits of the robot model and do not violate any constraints the robot has.\n\nGiven the desired robot's end-effector positions, inverse kinematics (IK) can determine an appropriate joint configuration for which the end-effectors move to the target pose.\n![center](images/1686552950187.jpg)\n\nOnce the robot's joint angles are calculated using the inverse kinematics, a motion profile can be generated using the Jacobian matrix to move the end-effector from the initial to the target pose","hash":"65bc1140b7675839b6c616bb77e9148b","class_name":"SmartBlock","length":953,"heading":null,"lines":[0,7]},"Engeneering/auronotic/Propellers/Sandmeyer Reaction.md":{"key":"Engeneering/auronotic/Propellers/Sandmeyer Reaction.md","path":"Engeneering/auronotic/Propellers/Sandmeyer Reaction.md","embedding":{},"text":"Engeneering > auronotic > Propellers > Sandmeyer Reaction: :\nThe Cl , Br and CN nucleophiles can easily be introduced in the benzene ring of benzene diazonium salt in the presence of Cu(I) ion.
