    "Engineering Calculations > Centrifugal Compressors > Axial Depth at Hub:\n\nDear Team,\n\nI have been reviewing the specifications for our centrifugal compressor, specifically focusing on the axial depth at the hub. To determine this parameter, we can follow these steps:\n\n- Measure the diameter of the impeller at the hub (D_hub).\n- Determine the diameter of the impeller at the shroud (D_shroud).\n- Calculate the average impeller diameter using the formula: D_avg = (D_hub + D_shroud) / 2.\n- Subtract the hub diameter from the average impeller diameter to find the axial depth at the hub: Axial Depth at Hub = D_avg - D_hub.\n\nPlease proceed with these calculations to obtain the axial depth at the hub for our centrifugal compressor.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]"

based on my node [[Centrifugal Compressors]] 
   how can i determine the axial depth at hub


##### assistant
Based on your notes on Centrifugal Compressors, the axial depth at the hub of the impeller is determined based on strength and vibration considerations. The hub diameter is usually obtained by considering strength and vibration factors. The size of the impeller shaft and the thickness of the metal required determine the hub diameter, which must be checked from a vibration point of view. The axial width of the hub is also determined based on strength considerations. 

Therefore, to determine the axial depth at the hub of the impeller, you need to consider the strength requirements and vibration considerations in relation to the impeller design.
