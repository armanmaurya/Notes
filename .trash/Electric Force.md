Electric force is the force that pushes apart two like charges, or that pulls together two unlike charges. Just like two magnets that snap together when you point the North end of of one magnet towards the South end of the other, two different electric charges (like a negative-charged electron and a positively-charged proton) always want to join together. The size of this attraction decreases as the distance between them increases.

When you point the North ends of two magnets towards each other (or if you do the same with two South ends), the magnets will repel each other. The same effect happens when you put two electrons near each other (or two protons). But once again, the magnitude of this repulsion gets smaller as the charges get further apart. Unlike magnets, through which always have north and south end, positive and negative charges can be separated and then brought back together.
