### Case 1 - Velocity is Parallel to Magnetic Field:-
If velocity of [Charge](../Jee/Physics/Electrostatics/Charge.md) particle is parallel (along or opposite) to the [Magnetic Field](../Magnetic%20Field.md) then as per the formula of [Charge in Magnetic field](Charge%20in%20Magnetic%20field.md) value of $\sin \theta$ is zero, So value of force exerts on the charged particle is zero.
$$
F= 0
$$
### Case 2 - Velocity is Perpendicular to Magnetic Field:
As per the formula of [Charge in Magnetic field](Charge%20in%20Magnetic%20field.md) value of $\sin \theta$ is 1. So value of force exerts on the charged particle is given by:
$$
F = qvB
$$
Where:
- $q$ is the charge on the particle 
- $v$ is the velocity of particle 
- $B$ is the magnitude of Magnetic field

Particle will follow the circular path with force (F) acting as a centripetal force. The radius of this circular path is given by:
$$
R = \frac{mv}{Bq} = \frac{P}{Bq} = \frac{\sqrt{ 2m(K.E) }}{Bq}
$$
Where:
- $m$ is the mass of particle 
- $P$ is the momentum of particle 
- K.E is the kinetic energy of particle 

Time period of the particle in circular path is given by:
$$
T = \frac{2\pi R}{v} = \frac{2\pi(m)}{Bq}
$$
As you can notice that time period is independent of velocity of charge. So, it doesn't matter what is the velocity of particle it will complete is motion in same time period.

Also, frequency is independent of velocity :
$$
f = \frac{1}{T}
$$
