The contents of EEPROM may be changed during operation (similar to RAM), but remains permanently saved even after the loss of power (similar to ROM). Accordingly, EEPROM is often used to store values, created during operation, which must be permanently saved. For example, if you design an electronic lock or an alarm, it would be great to enable the user to create and enter the password, but itâ€™s useless if lost every time the power supply goes off. The ideal solution is a microcontroller with an embedded EEPROM.
