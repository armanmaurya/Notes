Inter-integrated circuit is a system for serial data exchange between the microcontrollers and specialized integrated circuits of a new generation. It is used when the distance between them is short (receiver and transmitter are usually on the same printed board). Connection is established via two conductors. One is used for data transfer, the other is used for synchronization (clock signal). As seen in figure below, one device is always a master. It performs addressing of one slave chip before communication starts. In this way one microcontroller can communicate with 112 different devices. [Baud Rate](Baud%20Rate.md) is usually 100 Kb/sec (standard mode) or 10 Kb/sec (slow [Baud Rate](Baud%20Rate.md) mode). Systems with the [Baud Rate](Baud%20Rate.md) of 3.4 Mb/sec have recently appeared. The distance between devices which communicate over an I2C [Bus](Bus.md) is limited to several meters.
