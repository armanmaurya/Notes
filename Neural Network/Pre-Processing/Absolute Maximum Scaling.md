This method of scaling requires two-step:
1. We should first select the maximum absolute value out of all the entries of a particular measure.
2. Then after this, we divide each entry of the column by this maximum value.
$$
X_{\text{scaled}}=\frac{X_{i}-\text{max}(\mid X\mid)}{\text{max}(\mid X\mid)}
$$
