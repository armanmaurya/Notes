# CNN
CNNs are a class of Neural Network which work incredibly well on image data. They work similarly to how we humans recognize objects. The network first looks at the pixels of an image, then it gradually extracts the important features of the images using convolutions.

The terms convolution here refers to the mathematical combination of two functions, thus producing a third functions. CNNs perform convolutions on the image data using a filter or kernel, then produces a feature map.

The example above uses a robot as the input image and multiple feature maps for processing. You can see that the model produces an output via convolutions and subsampling.

The above images show the process of feature mapping. While to human eyes they just look like weird cat pictures, ==these filters allows computers to pinpoint important features of the image.==
