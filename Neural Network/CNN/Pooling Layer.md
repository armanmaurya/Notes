In simple terms, pooling is like down sampling. It reduces the size of the feature maps (or images) by summarising the information within a smaller region. Think of it as shrinking the image while keeping the most important parts of it.

A common [CNN](Convolutional%20Neural%20Network.md) model architecture is to have a number of convolution and pooling layers stacked one after the other.

**Why to use Pooling Layers?**
- Pooling layers are used to reduce the dimensions of the features maps. Thus, it reduces the number of parameter to learn and the amount of computation performed in the network.
- The pooling layer summarises the features present in a region of the feature map generated by a convolution layer. So, further operations are performed on summarized features instead of precisely positioned features generated by the convolution layer. This makes the model more robust to variations in the position of the features in the input image.

In [Convolutional Neural Network](Convolutional%20Neural%20Network.md), the pooling layer is common type of layer that is typically added after convolution layer. The pooling layer is used to reduce the spatial dimensions (i.e., the width and height) of the feature maps, while preserving the depth (i.e., the number of channels).
1. The pooling layer works by dividing the input feature map into a set of non-overlapping regions, called **pooling regions.** Each pooling region is then transformed into a single output value, which represents the presence of a particular feature in that region. The most common types of pooling operation are [Max Pooling](Max%20Pooling.md) and [Average Pooling](Average%20Pooling.md).

Pooling layers are typically used in conjunction with convolutional layer in a [Convolutional Neural Network](Convolutional%20Neural%20Network.md), with each pooling layer reducing the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, while the convolutional layers extract increasingly complex features from the input. The resulting feature maps are then passed to a fully connected layer, which performs the final classification or regression task.

**Advantages of Pooling Layer:**
1. Dimensionality reduction: The main advantage of pooling layers is that they help in reducing the spatial dimensions of the feature maps. This reduces the computational cost and also helps in avoiding overfitting by reducing the number of parameters in the model.
2. Translation invariance: Pooling layers are also useful in achieving translation invariance in the feature maps. This means that the position of an object in the image does not affect the classification result, as the same features are detected regardless of the position of the object.
3. Feature selection: Pooling layers can also help in selecting the most important features from the input, as max pooling selects the most salient features and average pooling preserves more information.

**Disadvantages of Pooling Layer:**
1. Information loss: One of the main disadvantages of pooling layers is that they discard some information from the input feature maps, which can be important for the final classification or regression task.
2. Over-smoothing: Pooling layers can also cause over-smoothing of the feature maps, which can result in the loss of some fine-grained details that are important for the final classification or regression task.
3. Hyperparameter tuning: Pooling layers also introduce hyperparameters such as the size of the pooling regions and the stride, which need to be tuned in order to achieve optimal performance. This can be time-consuming and requires some expertise in model building.
