# Polynomial In One Variable
An algebraic expression of the form:-
$$
p(x) = a_{n}x^2 + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + a_{n-2}x^{n-2} +\dots + a_{1}x^1 + a_{0}
$$
Where:-
- $a_{n}\ne 0$
- $a_{n},a_{n-1}, a_{n-2},\dots$ are coefficients of $x^n,x^{n-1},\dots,x^0$ respectively .
- $a_{n}x^n$ is called Leading term and its coefficient $a_{n}$, the leading coefficient.

**Note:-** If leading coefficient is '1' then the polynomial is called monic polynomial.

| Degree      | Name                 | General Form                | Last Name |     |     |
| ----------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- | --------- | --- | --- |
| (undefined) | Zero polynomial      | 0                           | 0         |     |     |
| 0           | Constant polynomial  | $a;(a\ne_{0})$              | 1         |     |     |
| 1           | Linear polynomial    | $ax+b;(a\ne_{0})$           | $x+1$     |     |     |
| 2           | Quadratic polynomial | $ax^2+bx+c;(a\ne0)$         | $x^2+1$   |     |     |
| 3           | Cubic polynomial     | $ax^3+bx^2+cx+d;(a\ne_{0})$ | $x^3+1$   |     |     |

Any polynomial equation of degree $n$ shall have exactly $n$ roots (real or imaginary) counted with multiplicity.
