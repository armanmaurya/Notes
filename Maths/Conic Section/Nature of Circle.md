By using [General Equation of Circle](General%20Equation%20of%20Circle.md) nature of circle can be defined based on its radius ($r = \sqrt{ g^2 + f^2-c }$) is,
1. If $g^2 + f^2-c = 0$ (Real circle with finite radius)
2. If $g^2+f^2-c=0$ (Point circle)
3. If $g^2+f^2-c=0$ (imaginary circle)

**Note:-**
Always chase for Centre and radius to get the equation of circle.
