If an random experiment has total $(m+n)$ mutually exclusive & equally likely outcomes, out of which m favours event 'E' then probability of occurrence of Event $E$ is denoted by $P(E)$ and $$P(E) = \frac{\text{favourable}}{\text{Total outcomes}}$$

**Important Note:**
1. Sum of probability of each sample point or probability of sample space = 1
2. If $P(E) = 0$, then event E is impossible event
3. If $P(E)=1$, then event E is Sure event.
4. Odds in favour of any event E = $\cfrac{\text{no. of fav. outcomes}}{\text{no. of unfav. outcomes}}$
5. Odds against event $E=\cfrac{\text{no. of unfav. outcomes}}{\text{no. of fav. outcomes}}$
6. Probability of non-occurrence of event $E=P(\bar{E})=P(E^c)=1-P(E)$

## Pure Experience :
1. Jab tak process complete na ho tab tak probabilities ko multiply krte hain. **(Multiplication principle)**
2. Jab classical formula na lge to each sample point ki probability nikalo aur sabhi favourable sample points ki probability add kr do.
