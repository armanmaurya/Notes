A [Scalar Matrix](Scalar%20Matrix.md) in which each diagonal element is unity ($i.e., \ 1$) is called a **unit matrix or identity matrix**.
Thus, a unit matrix is a square matrix in which all non-diagonal elements are zero and all diagonal elements are equal to $1$.
$i.e., \quad$ $A =[a_{ij}]_{n\times n}$ is a unit matrix if $a_{ij} =\begin{cases}0 & \text{when } i\ne j \\ 1 & \text{when } i = j\end{cases}$
A unit matrix of order $n$ is denoted by $I_{n}$. If the order is evident, it may be simply denoted by $I$.
Thus, $\quad \quad\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\0&1\end{bmatrix} = I_{2}, \begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&1\end{bmatrix}=I_{3}$
