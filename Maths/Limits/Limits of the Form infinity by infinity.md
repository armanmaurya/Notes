 For solving $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$ form, As we don't know what is infinity ($\infty$) but we know $\frac{1}{\infty}\to{0}$ so try to make $\frac{1}{\infty}$ in every $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$ form.

#### Case-1
Taking $x^n$ common from both numerator as well as denominator.

 **Lets take a example:-** 
 
 **Solve:** $$\lim_{ x \to \infty } \frac{4x^5 + 5x^3-2x + 1}{10x^5-4x^2-1 + x}$$
As you can see this is a $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$
For solving this question, take the highest power common in this case it is $x^5$ from numerator and $x^5$ also from denominator and we got, 
 $$\frac{\cancel{x^5}\left[ 4 + \frac{5}{x^2}-\frac{2}{x^4}+\frac{1}{x^5} \right]}{\cancel{x_{5}}\left[ 10- \frac{4}{x^3}+\frac{1}{x^5}+\frac{1}{x^4} \right]}$$
 We obtained $\frac{1}{\infty}$ form in numerator as well as in denominator that will be zero and we obtained,
 $$\frac{4}{10}= \frac{2}{5}$$
**Solve:** $$\lim_{ x \to \infty } \frac{4x^{7/2} + 3x^2-5x + 1}{7x^2-5x^{7/2}+3}$$ 
As you can also this is also a $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$ form. Take the highest power common $x^{7/2}$ in case of numerator and also $x^{7/2}$ in denominator, we got: 
$$\frac{4}{-5} = Answer$$ 

#### Case-2
Taking  $x^n$ common from numerator and $x^m$ common  from denominator
