# Circumcenter
- Point of intersection of the [Perpendicular Bisector](../3D%20Geometry/Perpendicular%20Bisector.md) of each side of a triangle.
- Circumcenter is equidistant from each vertex of the triangle, If $O$ is circumcenter of any triangle $ABC$, then $OA^2=OB^2=OC^2.$.
- It is a center of circle passing through the vertices of a triangle.
- For any triangle, we can always draw a circle passing through its vertices i.e. **Every Triangle is Cyclic**

## Find (C)
1. Find $Eq^n$ of [Perpendicular Bisector](../3D%20Geometry/Perpendicular%20Bisector.md) of two sides.
2. Solve the both $Eq^n$ & Find $x$ and $y$. Say ($x=x_{1},y=y_{1}$).
3. Circumcenter is $(x_{1},y_{1})$
$$\text{Or}$$
- Using the distance between the circumcenter and vertex
$$OA^2=OB^2=OC^2$$
