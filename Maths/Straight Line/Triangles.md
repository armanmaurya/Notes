In Geometry, triangles are the type of polygons, which have three sides and three vertices. This is a two-dimensional figure with three straight sides. A triangle is considered a 3-sided polygon. The sum of all the three angles of a triangle is equal to 180°. The triangle is contained in a single plane. Based on its sides and angle measurement, the triangle has six types.
## Types of Triangle

Based on the sides of a triangle, a triangle is classified into 3 types, namely:

1. Scalene Triangle – All the sides are of different measures.
2. Isosceles Triangle – Two sides of a triangle are of the same measure and the remaining side has a different measure.
3. Equilateral Triangle – All the 3 sides of a triangle are of the same measure.

Based on the angles of a triangle, a triangle is classified into 3 types, namely:

1. Acute Angle Triangle – All the angles of a triangle is less than 90°

2. Obtuse Angle Triangle – One of the angles of a triangle is greater than 90°

3. Right Angle Triangle – One of the angles of a triangle is equal to 90°

## Properties of Triangle

1. A triangle has three sides, three angles and three vertices.

2. Sum of all three interior angles of a triangle is 180°.

3. Sum of the length of two sides of the triangle is greater than its third side.

4. The area of a triangle is the half  the product of the base and the height

5. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of all the three sides of a triangle.

## Area of Triangle

One of the properties of a triangle is its area, which is the region covered by the three-sided polygon in a plane. The formula for any triangle’s area is given by;

$$
\text{Area of a Triangle} = ½ × Base × Height
$$

## Heron's Formula:-

One more formula has been introduced by a Mathematician, which is known as Heron’s Formula. This formula is used when the sides of the triangles are known to us. It is given by;

$$
A = \sqrt{ s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) }
$$

Where ‘s’ is the semi-perimeter of the triangle and given by;

$$
s = (a+b+c)/2
$$

Where a, b and c are the measure of the three sides of the triangle.

## Determinant Form

Let $A(x_{1},y_{1})$, $B(x_{2},y_{2})$ and $C(x_{3},y_{3})$ are vertices of a triangle, then

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Area of $\triangle$ABC} &=  |\frac{1}{2}\begin{vmatrix}
x_{1} & y_{2} & 1  \\
x_{2} & y_{2} & 1 \\
x_{3} & y_{3} & 1
\end{vmatrix}| \\
&= \frac{1}{2} |[x_{1}(y_{2}-y_{3}) + x_{2}(y_{3}-y_{1}) + x_{3}(y_{1}-y_{2})]|
\end{aligned}
$$

## Centres of Triangle

A triangle center refers to a special point located inside, on, or outside of a triangle that has a unique mathematical property in relation to the triangle's sides or angles. There are many different triangle centers, some of the most well-known ones include:-

### Centroid

The intersection point where the three median of a triangle meet. A median is a line segment that connects the midpoint of a side to the opposite vertex. The centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio (two parts towards the vertex, one part towards the midpoint).

### Orthocenter

The point where the altitudes of a triangle intersect. An altitude is a line segment drawn from a vertex perpendicular to the opposite side. The orthocenter can be inside, outside, or on the triangle depending on the type of triangle.
