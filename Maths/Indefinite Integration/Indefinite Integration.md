# Indefinite Integration
---
Integration is a reverse process of differentiation. The integral or primitive of a function f (x) with respects to $x$ is a differential function $\phi(x)$ such that the derivative of $\phi(x)$ with respect to $x$ is the given function $f(x)$. It is expressed symbolically as 
$$\int f(x) \, dx = \phi(x)$$
Thus, 
$$
\int f(x) \, dx = \phi(x)  \iff \frac{d}{dx}[\phi(x)] = f(x)
$$
This process of finding the integral of a function is called integration and the given function is called Integrand. Now, it is obvious that the operation of integration is the inverse operation of differentiation. Hence the integral of a function as also named as the anti-derivative of that function.

Further, we observe that,
$$
\begin{rcases}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) &= 2x \\
\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 + 2) &= 2x\\
\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 + k) &= 2x
\end{aligned}
\end{rcases} \implies \int 2x \, dx = x^2 + \text{constant} 
$$
So we always add a constant to the integral of function, which is called the constant of Integration. It is generally denoted by $c$. Due to the presence of this arbitrary constant such a integral is called an Indefinitely Integral.

Note:-
The result of integration are very different from differentiation. There is no standard formula for integration.
Always make sure to write the constant of integration. NEVER assume it as zero from you side.
