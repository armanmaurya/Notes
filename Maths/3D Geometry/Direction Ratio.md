Any 3 numbers a, b, c proportional to [Direction Cosine](Direction%20Cosine%20Of%20Vector.md)  called direction Ratio.
$$
\frac{l}{a} = \frac{m}{b} = \frac{n}{c}
$$

> There can be infinitely many sets of direction ratio (D.R) for a given line.

### Golden Point 
- In any vector, coefficient of $i, j, k$ are the direction ratio of that vector.
