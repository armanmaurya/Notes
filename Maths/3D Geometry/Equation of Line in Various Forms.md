There are three types of forms in which equation of line can be written are-
1. One Point Form
	1. Vector Form
	2. Cartesian Form
## 1. One Point Form
#### 1.1 Vector Form
In Order to find the equation of line in Vector Form, we need:
1. A point known on the line $A(x_{o}, y_{o},z_{o})$, Which has position vector is $\vec{a}$.
2. A direction vector $(\vec{v})$ for the line or Vector to which line is parallel.
3. A another unknown point on the line $P(x_{1}, y_{1}, z_{1})$, Which has position vector is $\vec{r}$.
Then, 
$$
\vec{AP} = \vec{r}-\vec{a}
$$
As $\vec{AP} \  || \ \vec{b} \implies \vec{r}-\vec{a} = \vec{\lambda}b$, Then Equation of Line will be 
$$
\boxed{\vec{r} = \vec{a} + \lambda \vec{b}}
$$
Where, 
$\vec{a}$ = Point through which line passes.
$\vec{b}$ = Vector to which line is parallel

#### 1.2 Cartesian Form
