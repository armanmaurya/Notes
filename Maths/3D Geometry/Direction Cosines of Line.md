Prerequisite:-
- [[Direction Cosine Of Vector]]

The direction cosines of a  line are the cosines of the angles which the line makes with the positive directions of the coordinate axes.
### How to find the Direction Cosine of Line
Steps to find D.C of Line are -
1. Draw a vector on the line 
2. Move that vector to Origin.
3. Find the D.C of that vector.
4. D.C of that vector is also D.C of line.
### Note:-
- If a line has [direction cosine](Jee/Maths/3D%20Geometry/Direction%20Cosine%20Of%20Vector.md) as l, m, n then unit vector along the line can be written as li + mi + nk
- If a line has [direction Ratio](Jee/Maths/3D%20Geometry/Direction%20Ratio.md)  as a, b, c then vector along line is given as ai + bj + ck
