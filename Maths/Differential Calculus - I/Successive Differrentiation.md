The derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$ is called the **first differential coefficient** of $y$ $\text{w.r.t}$ $x$. The differential coefficient of $\frac{dy}{dx}$, i.e., $\frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{dy}{dx} \right)$ is called **second derivative of $y \text{w.r.t} x$**, which we denote as $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$. So, 
> The process of finding the differential coefficient of a function again and again is called **Successive Differentiation**.

Thus, if $y=f(x)$, the **successive differential coefficient** of $f(x)$ are
$$
\frac{dy}{dx}, \frac{d^2y}{dx^2}, \frac{d^3y}{dx^3},\dots, \frac{d^ny}{dx^n}
$$
These are also denoted by:
1. $y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3},\dots,y_{n}$
2. $y', y'', y''',\dots y(n)$
3. $Dy, D^2y, D^3y\dots D^ny$
4. $f'(x), f''(x), f'''(x),\dots, f^n(x)$

## Calculation of $n^{th}$ order Derivatives
1. **To find the $n^{th}$ differential coefficient of $x^m$**.   $$\frac{d^m}{dx^m}(x^m) = m!$$
2. **The $n^{th}$ differential coefficient of $(ax+b)^m$, where $n<m.$**
