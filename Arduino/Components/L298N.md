### 5. **Controlling Motors with Arduino**

The L 298 N allows you to control the direction and speed of the motors using digital signals and PWM. The following Arduino code snippet demonstrates how to control two DC motors:

**Example Arduino Code**:
```cpp
// Define motor control pins
#define ENA 5   // Enable pin for Motor A
#define IN1 8   // Control pin 1 for Motor A
#define IN2 9   // Control pin 2 for Motor A
#define ENB 6   // Enable pin for Motor B
#define IN3 10  // Control pin 1 for Motor B
#define IN4 11  // Control pin 2 for Motor B

void setup() {
  // Set motor control pins as OUTPUT
  pinMode(ENA, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(IN1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(IN2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(ENB, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(IN3, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(IN4, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Move Motor A forward
  digitalWrite(IN1, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(IN2, LOW);
  analogWrite(ENA, 255);  // Full speed

  // Move Motor B backward
  digitalWrite(IN3, LOW);
  digitalWrite(IN4, HIGH);
  analogWrite(ENB, 255);  // Full speed

  delay(2000);  // Run for 2 seconds

  // Stop Motors
  digitalWrite(IN1, LOW);
  digitalWrite(IN2, LOW);
  digitalWrite(IN3, LOW);
  digitalWrite(IN4, LOW);
  delay(1000);  // Stop for 1 second

  // Move Motor A backward
  digitalWrite(IN1, LOW);
  digitalWrite(IN2, HIGH);
  analogWrite(ENA, 255);  // Full speed

  // Move Motor B forward
  digitalWrite(IN3, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(IN4, LOW);
  analogWrite(ENB, 255);  // Full speed

  delay(2000);  // Run for 2 seconds

  // Stop Motors
  digitalWrite(IN1, LOW);
  digitalWrite(IN2, LOW);
  digitalWrite(IN3, LOW);
  digitalWrite(IN4, LOW);
  delay(1000);  // Stop for 1 second
}
