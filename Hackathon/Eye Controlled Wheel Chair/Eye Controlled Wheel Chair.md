# Hardware Require
- **Raspberry Pi**: Can be used to run the eye-tracking algorithm (like out Python-based OpenCV solution)
- **ESP-WROOM-32**: Because we need a **FreeRTOS**.
- **Arduino-uno**: To Interface the **ESP-WROOM-32**.
- **12V-24V Brushed DC Motors (200W - 350W)**: For forward and backward operations.
- **L298N Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver**: For testing purpose but we require **Sabertooth 2x25A Motor Driver** for actual product.
- **Hitec HS-7950TH Ultra Torque Servo**: For stearing purpose.
- **Power Supply:** Batteries for the wheelchair motor and for powering other electronic components.
- **High-Resolution Webcam (720p or higher):** Ensures better accuracy for detecting eye movements.
