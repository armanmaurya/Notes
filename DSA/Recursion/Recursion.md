**Recursion** is defined as a process which calls itself directly or indirectly and the corresponding function is called a recursive function.
## Properties
Recursion has some important properties. Some of which are mentioned below:

- The primary property of recursion is the ability to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems, each of which can be solved in the same way.
- A recursive function must have a base case or stopping criteria to avoid infinite recursion.
- Recursion involves calling the same function within itself, which leads to a call stack.
- Recursive functions may be less efficient than iterative solutions in terms of memory and performance.
## Types
1. **Direct recursion:** When a function is called within itself directly it is called direct recursion. This can be further categorised into four types: 
    - [Tail Recursion](Tail%20Recursion.md),  
    - Head recursion,  
    - Tree recursion and 
    - Nested recursion.
2. **Indirect recursion:** Indirect recursion occurs when a function calls another function that eventually calls the original function and it forms a cycle.
## Applications
Recursion is used in many fields of computer science and mathematics, which includes:

- Searching and sorting algorithms: Recursive algorithms are used to search and sort data structures like trees and graphs.
- Mathematical calculations: Recursive algorithms are used to solve problems such as factorial, Fibonacci sequence, etc.
- Compiler design: Recursion is used in the design of compilers to parse and analyze programming languages.
- Graphics: many computer graphics algorithms, such as fractals and the Mandelbrot set, use recursion to generate complex patterns.
- Artificial intelligence: recursive neural networks are used in natural language processing, computer vision, and other AI applications.
## Advantages
- Recursion can simplify complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces.
- Recursive code can be more readable and easier to understand than iterative code.
- Recursion is essential for some algorithms and data structures.
- Also with recursion, we can reduce the length of code and become more readable and understandable to the user/ programmer.
## Disadvantages
- Recursion can be less efficient than iterative solutions in terms of memory and performance.
- Recursive functions can be more challenging to debug and understand than iterative solutions.
- Recursion can lead to stack overflow errors if the recursion depth is too high.
