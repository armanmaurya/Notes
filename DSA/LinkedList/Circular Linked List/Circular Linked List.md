A ***circular linked list*** is a data structure where the last node connects back to the first, forming a loop. This structure allows for continuous traversal without any interruptions. Circular linked lists are especially helpful for tasks like **scheduling** and **managing playlists,** this allowing for smooth navigation. In this tutorial, we’ll cover the basics of circular linked lists, how to work with them, their advantages and disadvantages, and their applications.
## What is a Circular Linked List?
A **circular linked list** is a special type of linked list where all the nodes are connected to form a circle. Unlike a regular linked list, which ends with a node pointing to **NULL**, the last node in a circular linked list points back to the first node. This means that you can keep traversing the list without ever reaching a **NULL** value.
## Types of Circular Linked Lists
We can create a circular linked list from both [Singly Linked List](../Singly%20Linked%20List/Singly%20Linked%20List.md) and [Doubly Linked List](../Doubly%20Linked%20List/Doubly%20Linked%20List.md). So, circular linked list are basically of two types:
