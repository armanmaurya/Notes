IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS REPRESENTATION OF AN ELEMENT Mass number Atomic number A X Symbol of the element Terms associated with elements :Atomic Number (Z) : = No. of protons Electron = Z – C (charge on atom) • Mass number (A) =Total number of neutron and proton present A = Number of proton + Number of Neutrons • Isotopes : Same atomic number but different mass number : 6C 12, 6C 13, 6C 14 • Isobars : Same mass number but different atomic number Ex. 1H 3, 2He 3 • Isodiaphers : Same difference of number of Neutrons & protons 5B 11, 6C 13 • Isotones : Having same number of neutron Ex. 1H 3, 2He 4 • Isosters: They are the molecules which have the same number of atoms & electrons Ex. CO 2, N 2O • Isoelectronic:Species having same no. of electrons Cl –, Ar ATOMIC MODELS • Thomson : An atom considered to be positively charged sphere where e– is embedded inside it. • Drawback : Cannot explain stability of an atom. • Rutherford Model of an atoms : Electron is revolving around the nucleus in circular path. R N = R 0(A)1/3, R 0 = 1.33 × 10–13 cm [A = mass number, RN = Radius of nucleus] SIZE OF NUCLEUS • The volume of the nucleus is very small and is only a minute fraction of the total volume of the atom. Nucleus has a diameter of the order of 10 – 12 to 10 –13 cm and the atom has a diameter of the order of 10–8 cm. • Thus, diameter (size) of the atom is 1,00,000 times the diameter of the nucleus.
