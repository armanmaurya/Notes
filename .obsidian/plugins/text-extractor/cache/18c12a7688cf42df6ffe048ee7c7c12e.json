Centrifugal compressors • Besides small aero engines, centrifugal compressors are used in the auxiliary power units (APUs) in many aircraft. • Some of the aircraft air conditioning systems employ centrifugal compressors. • In a few engines, centrifugal compressors are used as the final stage of the compression process downstream of a multi-stage axial compressor. Eg. GE T 700, P&W PT6, Honeywell T53.

Conservation of Rothalpy • If we were to assume steady, viscous flow without heat transfer • Here, I, is the rotational enthalpy or rothalpy. • It is now known that rothalpy is conserved for the flow through the impeller. • Any change in rothalpy is due to the fluid friction acting on the stationary shroud (if considered in the analysis).

It is the rotating component of the centrifugal compressor. • The diverging passages of the impeller diffuses the flow to a lower relative velocity and higher static pressure. • Impellers may be single-sided or double- sided, shrouded or un-shrouded. • In the impeller, the working fluid also experiences centripetal forces due to the rotation. shrouded impeller un-shrouded impeller Impeller • In principle, there are three possibilities for a centrifugal compressor rotor. – Straight radial – Forward leaning – Backward leaning • Forward leaning blades are not used due inherent dynamic instability. • Straight and backward leaning blades are commonly used in modern centrifugal compressor rotors.
