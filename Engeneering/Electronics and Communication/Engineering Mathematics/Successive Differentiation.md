If $y=f(x)$, its differential coefficient $\cfrac{dy}{dx}$ is also a function of *x*.

$\cfrac{dy}{dx}$ is further differentiated and derivative of $\cfrac{dy}{dx}$ *i.e.* $\cfrac{d}{dx}\left( \cfrac{dy}{dx} \right)$ is called the second differential coefficient of y and is denoted by $\cfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}$.

Similarly third differential coefficient of y with respect to *x* is written $\cfrac{d^3y}{dx^3}$.

Thus $\cfrac{d^ny}{dx^n}$ is the $n^{th}$ derivative of *y* with respect to $x$

# Calculation of $n^{th}$ Derivative 
1. $n^{th}$ derivative of $x^{m}$ $$\boxed{\frac{d^m}{dx^m}x^m = m!}$$
2. $n^{th}$ derivative of $e^{ax}$ $$\boxed{y_{n} = a^n e^{ax}}$$
3. $n^{th}$ derivative of $a^{mx}$ $$y_{n} = a^x (\log a)^n$$
