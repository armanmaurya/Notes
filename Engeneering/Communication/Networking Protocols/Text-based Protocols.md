A text-based protocol or plain text protocol represents its content in human-readable format, often in plain text encoded in a machine-readable encoding such as ASCII or UTF-8 or in structured text-based formats such as XML or JSON.

The immediate human readability stands in contrast to native binary protocols which have inherent benefits for using in a computer environments (such as each of mechanical parsing and improved bandwidth utilisation).

Network applications have various methods of encapsulating data One method very common with Internet protocols is a text oriented representation that transmits requests and responses as line of ASCII text, terminated by a newline character (and usually a carriage return character). Examples of protocols that use plain, human-readable text for its commands are FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), early versions of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), and finger protocol.

Text-based protocols are typically optimized for human parsing and interpretation and are therefore suitable whenever human inspection of protocol contents is required, such as during debugging and during early protocol development design phases.
