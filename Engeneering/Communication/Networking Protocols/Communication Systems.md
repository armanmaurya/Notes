The information exchanged between devices through a network or other media is governed by rules and conventions that can be set out in commutation protocol specifications. The nature of commutation, the actual data exchanged and any state-dependent behaviour, is defined by these specifications. In digital computing systems, the rules can be expressed by algorithms and data structures. Protocols are to communication what algorithms or programming languages are to computations.

Operating systems usually contain a set of cooperating process that manipulate shared data to communicate with each other. This communication is governed by well-understoop protocols, which can be embedded in the process code itself.

## Types:-
There are two types of communication protocols, based on their representation of the content beging carried:
- [Text-based Protocols](Text-based%20Protocols.md) 
- [Binary-based Protocol](Binary-based%20Protocol.md)
