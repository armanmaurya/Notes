A universal motor is a special type of motor that,
- Runs on both AC and DC power supplies.
- Series-wound (the armature and field windings are in series), this allows them to generate high torque.
- Operate at speed as high as 3500 RPM.
- Runs at higher speed on DC supply then they run on AC supply of same voltage, due to reactance voltage drop that is present only in AC and not in DC.
