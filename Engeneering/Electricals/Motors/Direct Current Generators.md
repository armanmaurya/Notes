## 2. Mechanical Construction 
A cross-section of 4-pole dc machine is shown in Figure 5.2. Only the main components of the machine have been identified and are discussed below.
### Stator 
The stator of a dc machine provides the mechanical support for the machine and consists of the yoke and the pole (or **field poles**). The yoke serves the basic function of providing a highly permeable path for the magnetic flux. For small permanent-magnet (PM) machines, it can be rolled-ring structure welded at its ends. For small wound machines, the field poles and the yoke are punched as one unit from thin steel laminations. For large machines, the yoke is built using cast steel sections.
The pole are mounted inside the yoke and are properly designed to accommodate the field windings. Most often, the field poles are made of thin laminations stacked together. This is done to minimize the magnetic losses due to the poles proximity to the armature flux. For large machines, the field pole and a field winding are shown in Figure-3. Note that the cross-sectional area of the field pole is smaller than that of the pole shoe. This is done (a) to provide sufficient room for the field winding and (b) to decrease the mean turn length of the wire and thereby reduce its weight and cost. **The pole shoe helps to spread the flux in the air-gap region**.

### Field Winding 
The field coils are wound on the poles in such a way that the poles alternate in their polarity. There are two types of field windings -- **a shunt field winding** and **series field winding**. The shunt field winding has many turns of fine wire and derives its name from the fact that it is connected in parallel with the armature windings. A series field winding, as the name implies, is connected in series with the armature winding and has comparatively fewer turns of heavy wire. A dc machine may have both field windings wound on the same pole.
A machine with a shunt field winding is called a shunt machine. A **series machine** is wound only with series field winding. A **compound machine** has both windings. When both field windings in a compound produce fluxes in the same direction, the machine is said to be of the **cumulative** type. The machine is of the **differential** type when the field set up by shunt field winding is opposed by the field established by the series field winding.
Since the field winding carries a constant current, it dissipates power. By using permanent magnets instead of a shunt field winding, we can eliminate the power loss and thereby improve the efficiency of the machine. The disadvantage of a PM machine, of course is its constant flux.

### Armature 
The rotating part of a dc machine, which is shrouded by the fixed poles on the stator, is called the armature. The effective length of the armature is usually the same as that of the pole. Circular in cross-section, it is made of thin, highly permeable, and electrically insulated steel laminations that are stacked together and rigidly mounted on the shaft. Highly permeability ensures a low reluctance path for the magnetic flux, and electrical insulation reduces the eddy currents in the armature core. The laminations have axial slots on their periphery to house the armature coils (**armature winding**). Usually an insulated copper wire is used for the armature coils owing to its low resistivity.

#### Commutator 
The commutator is made of wedge-shaped, hard-drawn copper segments as shown in Figure-4. It is also rigidly mounted on the shaft as depicted in Figure-1. The copper segments are insulated from one another by sheets of mica. One end of two armature coils is electrically connected to the armature winding is the heart of a dc machine. This is the winding in which the emf is induced (generator action) and the torque is developed (motor action). The armature winding, therefore, warrants a detailed discussion. That, in fact, is the subject of the next section.
The commutator is a very well conceived device that serves the function of a rectifier. It converts the alternating emf induced in the armature coils into a unidirectional voltage.

#### Brushes 
Brushes are held in a fixed position on the commutator by means of brush holders. An adjustable spring inside the brush holders exerts a constant pressure on the brush in order to maintain a proper contact between the brush and the commutator. The brush pressure should be just right. If the pressure is low, the contact between the brush and the commutator is poor. The poor contact results in excessive sparking and burning of the commutator. On the other hand, to high a pressure results is excessive wear of the brush and overheating of the commutator through friction.
There are many different brush grades, depending upon their composition. A brush may be made of carbon, carbon graphite, or a copper-filled carbon mixture. The graphite in a brush provides self-lubrication between the brush and the commutator.
Although the brush holders are mounted on the end bell, they are electrically insulated from it. A brush is electrically connected to the brush holders by braided copper wire called the **pigtail**. Through these brush holders we can establish an electrical connection between the external circuit and the armature coils.

## 3. Armature Windings

The armature slots are usually insulated with “fish” paper to protect the windings. For small machines, the coils are directly wound into the armature slots using automatic winders. for large machines, the coils are preformed and then inserted into the armature slots. Each coil may have many turns of enamel-covered (insulated) copper wire.

➤ **Pole-Pitch ↴**

The Number of slots in the armature divided by the number of poles of the generator **or** the distance between two adjacent poles **or** Number of Slots between two poles. 

➤ **Coil-Pitch or Coil Span ↴**

It is the distance measured in term of armature slots ( or armature conductors ) between two sides of a coil

1. **Full-Pitch Winding :** When Coil Pitch is equal to Pole Pitch **or** When the distance between the two sides of coil is 180$\degree$ electrical, i other words, when one side is under the center of south pole and other side must be under the center of the adjacent north pole**,** also note that maximum emf is induced in Full-Pitch coil.
2. **Short-Pitch Winding :** When the Coil Pitch is less than Pole Pitch **or** When the distance between the two side of coil is less than 180$\degree$ electrical. For 2-pole machine, fractional pitch coil is use it is quite to place full-pitch coils. Another advantage of this type of coil is that it uses less copper wire than full-pitch coil. **However, the induced emf is reduced by a factor called the pitch factor.**

The most commonly used winding is a two-layer winding. The number of coils for a two-layer winding is equal to the number of armature slots. Thus, each armature slot has two sides of two different coils.

When the number of slots is not exactly divisible by the number of poles, it is not even possible to wind a full-pitch coil. In that case, the maximum possible pitch may be used as the fractional pitch of the coil. **The maximum pitch of the coil can be determined form the following equation**

$$ y = \text{integer value of ($\frac{S}{P}$}) $$

where y is the coil pitch in slots, S is the number of slots in the armature, and P is the number of poles in the machine. This equation yields the pitch as an integer value of the slots per pole. If we place one side of the coil in slot **m** + _y_

How we connect the armature winding to the commutator described the type of winding. There are two general types of windings — The lap winding the the wave winding. The lap winding, is used for low-voltage and high-current machines. The wave winding, on the other hand, is employed to satisfy the requirements of high voltage and low current.

Each winding is further classified as simplex, duplex, triplex and so on. We limit out discussion to simplex-lap and simplex-wave windings and refers to them simply as lap and wave winding. There is no difference between the two types for a 2-pole machine. Both require two brushes and have two parallel paths. The number of parallel paths of a lap-wound machine is equal to the number of poles. However, a wave-wound machine always has two parallel paths, regardless of the number of poles.

### 3.1 Lap Winding

In a lap-wound machine the two end of a coil are connected to adjacent commutator segments. Let us assume that **C** coils are to be connected to C segments of the commutator. If we connect coil 1 to commutator segments 1 and 2, then coil 2 can be connected to commutator segment 2 and 3. As viewed from the commutator segments 1 and 3, the two coils are now connected in series. we can now connect coil 3 to commutator segments 3 and 4. Following this procedure, we end up connecting coil C to commutator segments **C** and 1. All the winding are now connected in series and form a closed loop. **The winding is said to close upon itself.** A polar diagram of 6-pole, 12-coil dc machine with 12 commutator segments is shown in Figure 5.6 with a coil pitch of 2.

For a clockwise rotation, coil 1 is leaving the north pole and the flux linking the coil is decreasing. The indicated direction of the current in coil 1 ensures that the flux created by it opposes the decrease in the flux in accordance with Faraday’s law of induction. On the other hand, the flux linking coil 12 is increasing as it moves under the north pole. The direction of the current in this coil must create a flux that opposes the increase. Progressing in this manner form one coil to another, we determine the directions of the currents in all coils. Note that at segments 1, 5 and 9, both currents are directed away form the commutator. For a dc generator, these segments mark the placement of brushes having negative polarity. The potential difference between a positive brush at commutator segment 3 and a negative brush at commutator segment 1 is equal to the induced emf in coils 1 and 2. In fact, only two coils are contributing to the potential difference between a positive and a negative brush. Thus, the three negative brushes can be electrically connected together to form a single connection. Likewise, we can connect the three positive brushes to form a single by a single loop it must be borne in mind, however, that each loop represents the two sides of a coil that are properly placed in armature slots. Note that there are six parallel paths for a -pole, lap-wound machine. Each path contributes to one-sixth of the armature current. As shown in Figure 5.7, when the armature supplies a current of 12A, the current in each coil is 2A.

If we view each side of a coil as a conductor, then we can determine how these conductors are connected in the front ( commutator side) and in the back (opposite side to the commutator). A part of the polar diagram of Figure 5.6 is shown in Figure 5.8. The coil sides have been numbered in the clockwise direction beginning with sides in slot 1. For example, the sides of coil 1 have been numbered 1 and 6, and those coil 2, 3 and 8. Since sides 1 and 6 are connected on the back side , the back pitch ( _y$_f$_) is 3. **The front pitch and the back pitch must both be odd for the winding to be properly placed in armature slots. The difference between the two pitches is always 2.** The winding is said to be **progressive** when $y_b = y_f$ + 2. If $y_f = y_b$ + 2, the winding is said to be **retrogressive.** A ( progressive/ retrogressive ) winding advance in the (clockwise/counterclockwise) direction when viewed from the commutator side. In out example, the winding is progressive.

For simplex lap-wound armature, the front and the back pitches can be computed as

$$ y_f = \frac{2C}{P} - 1 $$

and

$$ y_b = \frac{2C}{P} + 1 $$

for progressive windings, and

$$ y_f = \frac{2C}{P} + 1 $$

and

$$ y_b = \frac{2C}{P}-1 $$

for retrogressive windings.

As viewed from the winding connections made to the commutator segments, we observe that the winding advances one commutator segment for each coil. Hence, the commutator pitch (yc) is 1.

If is left to the reader to verify that a 4-pole, lap-wound machine needs four brushes and has four parallel paths. In summary, the number of brushes and the parallel paths in a lap-wound machine are equal to its number of poles.

### 3.2 Wave Winding

The wave winding differs from the lap winding only in the way the coils are connected to the commutator segments. In the lap winding, the two ends of a coil are connected to adjacent commutator segments ($y_c$ = 1). In the wave winding, the two ends of a coil are connected to those segments of the commutator that are approximately ( but not exactly) 360$^\text{o}$ electrical apart ( 2-pole pitches). This is done to ensure that the entire winding closes onto itself only once. By making connections almost 2-pole pitches apart, we are connecting in series only those coils that are under the same polarity poles. That is, coil under one north pole is connected to another coil comparably placed under the next north pole, and so on.

For the simplex-wave winding, the number of commutator segments per pole should be such that the following are true:

1. The commutator pitch can be either little more or less that 360$^\text{o}$ electrical.
2. After passing once around the commutator, the last coil should be either one segment ahead (progressive) or behind (retrogressive) the starting segment.

The above requirements dictate that the number of commutator segments per pair of poles should not be an integer. Since the commutator pitch must be an integer, the number of commutator segments for a simplex-wave winding must be determined from the following equation:

$$ C = y_c\Big(\frac{P}{2}\Big) \pm 1 $$

******where****** C is the total number of commutator segments, _y$_c$_ is the commutator pitch ( an integer), and P is the number of poles. The (plus/minus) sign is for the (progressive / retrogressive) winding.

The above equation can also be written as

$$ y_c = \frac{C \pm 1}{\cfrac{P}{2}} $$
## 4. Induced emf equation

When a single-turn coil rotates in a uniform magnetic field, the average value of the induced emf, form Section 3.4, is

$$ E_c = \frac{P}{\pi} \Phi_p \omega_m $$

**where** P is the number of poles in a dc machine, $\Phi_p$ is the flux per pole, and $\omega_m$ is the angular velocity of the armature. We also obtained an expression for the frequency of the induced voltage in the coil as

$$ f = \frac{P}{4\pi} \omega_m $$

From the above equation, we can obtain an expression for the armature speed in revolutions per minute (rpm) as

$$ N_m = \frac{120f}{P} $$

From our discussion in the preceding sections, it must be obvious not only that a dc machine has coils properly wound on the armature but the each coil usually has several turns. In addition, the coils are connected in parallel paths: two for the wave winding, and P for the lap winding.

Let N$_c$ be the turns per coil, C the total number of coils (slots for a two-layer winding), and $a$ number of parallel paths ( a = 2 for wave winding, or a = P for the lap winding); then turns per parallel path are

$$ N_a = \frac{C}{a} N_c $$

Note that N$_a$ represents that turns connected in series between a negative brush and a positive brush. Consequently, the average value of the total emf induced between the terminals of the two brushes is

$$ E_a = \frac{PC}{\pi a}N_c\omega_m\Phi_p $$

Since there are two conductors per turn, the total number of conductor, Z, in all the slots of the armature is

$$ Z = 2CN_c $$

Expressing Eq.( 5.8) in terms of the total conductors in the armature slots, we obtain

$$ E_a = \frac{PZ}{2\pi a}\Phi_p\omega_m $$

The above equation for the induced emf in the armature winding is traditionally written as

$$ E_a = K_a\Phi_p\omega_m $$

where,

$$ K_a = \frac{ZP}{2\pi a} $$

is a constant quantity for a given machine and is routinely referred to as the ********************************machine constant.******************************** Equation ( 5.10) is valid for both dc generator and motors. In the case of a dc generator, E$_a$ is known as the ******generated emf******, or **********************************generated voltage**********************************. It is called the ******************back emf****************** when the dc machine operates as a motor.

 In the above development, we have tacitly assumed that the magnetic poles cover the entire armature periphery. That is, a pole arc subtends an angle of 180$^\text{o}$ electrical. This is a virtual impossibility, especially for a wound machine. However, we can design machines in which the poles cover 60% to 80% of the armature periphery. This fact can be taken into consideration when computing the flux per pole.

 If the armature of a dc generator supplies a constant current *I$_a$* to an external load, the electrical power developed by the generator is

$$ P_d = E_aI_a = K_a\Phi_p\omega_mI_a $$

An equivalent power must be supplied by the mechanical system (the prime mover coupled to the armature). If _T$_d$_ is the average mechanical torque developed by the armature of a dc generator, the prime mover must supply an equal amount of torque in the opposite direction to keep the armature rotating at a constant speed $\omega_m$. Since in mechanical system the power developed is

$$ P_d = T_d\omega_m $$

the torque developed, form Eq. (5.12), is

$$ T_d = K_a\Phi_pI_a $$

Equation (5.13) is also valid for a dc motor in which the electrical power supplied to the armature (P$_d$) must be balanced by the mechanical power ( T$_d$$\\omega_m$) delivered to the load. Equation (5.13), therefore, symbolizes the transition from mechanical power to electrical power in a dc generator, or vice versa in a dc motor. In the next section, we arrive at the torque expression, Eq. ( 5.14), from a different perspective.

## 5. Developed Torque

In Section 3.4, we obtained an expression for the torque experienced by a single-turn, current-carrying coil in a uniform magnetic field as

$$ T_e = 2BiLr $$

where **B** is the uniform flux density, _i_ is the current in the coil, L is effective length of each conductor of the coil that is exposed to the magnetic filed, and r is the radius at which each conductor of the coil that is exposed to the magnetic field, and _r_ is the radius at which each conductor is located. In the case of a dc machine, ****************L**************** is the length ( stack height of the armature and _r_ is its radius.

Although the current in the coil varies sinusoidally, the current in a conductor under a magnetic pole is of the full-wave rectified type. If _I$_c$_ is the average value of the current, then the average torque acting on a single-turn coil is:

$$ T_c = 2BLrI_c $$

Since a dc machine with _P_ pole has **C** coils connected in parallel paths and each coil has _N$_c$_ turns, the total number of turns is **CN$_c$*. If _I$_a$_ is the average dc current, then _I$_a$/a_ is the current in each turn. Hence, the average torque developed by a dc machine is

$$ 
\begin{aligned}T_d &= \text{Torque developed by one turn $\times$ total turns}\\ &= \Bigg[2BLr\frac{I_a}{a}\Bigg][CN_c] \\ &= \frac{BLrZ}{a}I_a \end{aligned}
$$

If _A$_p$_ is the area of each pole, that is,

$$ A_p = \frac{2\pi r L}{P} $$

then the torque developed by the dc machine becomes

$$ \begin{aligned}T_d &= \frac{PZ}{2]\pi a}BA_pI_a \\ &= K_a\Phi_pI_a \end{aligned} $$

where,

$$ K_a = \frac{PZ}{2\pi a} $$

is the machine constant and $\Phi_p$ = *_BA $_p$ _ is the total flux per pole. Equation( 5.17) is exactly the same as Eq. (5.14), which was obtained from the power developed point of view.
## 6. Magnetization Characteristic of DC Machine

The induced emf in the armature winding of a dc machine is directly proportional to **(a)** the flux per pole and ******(b)****** the armature speed. Let us assume that the field winding of a dc machine is connected to a variable dc source that is capable of supplying a desired field current. If the armature circuit is left open and the armature is rotated at the rated speed of the machine, then the induced emf in the machine can be expressed as

$$ E_a = K_1\Phi_p $$

where _K$_1$ = K$_a$$\omega$$_m$_ is a constant quantity. In other words, the induced emf is directly proportional to the flux in the machine.

The flux per pole $\Phi_p$ depends upon the magnetomotive force (mmf) provided by the current _I$_f$_ in the field winding. Since the number of turns per pole is fixed, the flux per pole is a function of the field current _I$_f$._ That is,

$$ \Phi_p = k_fi_f $$

where $k_f$ is a constant of proportionality.

The induced emf can now be written as

$$ E_a = K_1k_fI_f $$

Since the magnetic circuit of a dc machine consists of both linear regions (airgaps) and non-linear regions ( magnetic material for the stator and the armature), _k$_f$_ change with the change in the flux ( or flux density) in the machine. To be precise, _k$_f$_ decreases as flux in the machine increase. Simply stated, the induced emf E$_a$ does not vary linearly with the filed current _I$_f$._

The relationship between _E $_a$ _ and I $_f$ **********can, however, be determined by measuring _E $_a$ _ at different values of _I $_f$ _ at a constant (usually rated) armature speed. When _E $_a$ _ is plotted as a function of _I $_f$ _ Figure 5.11), the curve is known as the ********************************************no-load characteristic******************************************** owing to the fact that the armature is not loaded. Since _E $_a$ _ is an indirect measure of flux ( or flux density) per pole and _I $_f$ _ is a measure of the applied mmf (armature-turns per pole), the curve is bound to be similar to the _**B-H**_ curve of the magnetic material. For that reason, the no-load curve is frequently referred to as the ********************magnetization curve (characteristic) of a dc machine.********************

Magnetization curves can be experimentally determined for both the increasing (ascending) and decreasing (descending) values of the field current. The two curves should not be expected to overlap owing to hysteresis. In other words, for any given value of the field current, the flux in the machine depends upon whether the current was increasing or decreasing to react the value in question. Therefore, **********************************************************************************************************************during the experiment the field current should be varied continuously in own direction only.********************************************************************************************************************** In order to simplify theoretical calculations involving the use of the magnetization curve, it is an accepted practice to take the mean of the two curves and refer to it as the magnetization curve.

The induced emf does not start at zero when the field current is zero but at some value somewhat greater owing to the residual magnetism from the previous operation of the machine. This value of the induced emf is called the ******************************residual emf, _E$_r$._** Except for that, the lower part of the magnetization curve is practically a straight line. This due to the fact that the mmf required for the magnetic material is almost negligible at small value of flux density in the machine. Stated differently, most of the reluctance of the magnetic circuit is in the air-gap. The upper part of the curve shows the aftermath of saturation of the magnetic material when the flux density in the machine is high. The bending of the curve to the right provides evidence that part of the applied mmf is being consumed by the reluctance of the magnetic material. The rest of the mmf is, of course, necessary to set up the flux in the air-gap. By drawing an air-gap to set up a given flux (to induce a given emf). The remainder of the mmf is required by the magnetic material.

Since the induced emf is directly proportional to the armature speed, we can plot the magnetization curve at any speed by making use of the magnetization curve at the rated speed. If _E$_{a1}$_ is the induced emf at a field current of _I$_f$_ when the armature is rotating at a speed of $\omega_{m1}$, then the induced emf _E$_{a2}$_ at the same field current but at a speed of $\omega_{m2}$ is:

$$ E_{a2} = \frac{\omega _{m2}}{\omega _{m1}} E_{a1} $$

For the operation of all self-excited generators, we will show the saturation of the magnetic material is, in fact, a blessing in disguise. That is, the bending of the magnetization curve to the right is necessary for the successful operation of a self-excited generator.

## 7. Theory of Commutation 
For the successful operation of a dc machine, the induced emf in each conductor under a pole must have the same polarity. If the armature winding is carrying current, the current in each conductor under a pole must be directed in the same direction. It implies that as the conductor moves from one pole to the next, there must be a reversal of the current in that conductor. The conductor and thereby the coil in which the current reversal is taking place are said to be **commutating**. The process of reversal of current in a commutating coil is known as **commutation**. Ideally, the process of commutation should be instantaneous, as indicated in Figure-12a. This can, however, be achieved only if the brush width and the commutator segments are infinitesimally small. In practice, not only do the brush and the commutator have finite width but coil also has a finite inductance. Therefore, it takes some time for the current reversal to take place, as illustrated in Figure-12b.
Figure-13a shows a set of eight coils connected to the commutator segments of a 2-pole dc generator. The coils g, h, a, and b are under the north pole and form one parallel path. The current in each coil is $I_{c}$. The width of each brush is assumed to be equal to the width of the commutator segment. Brush *A* is riding on commutator segment 3 while brush B is on segment 7. The current through each brush is $2I_{c}$. As the commutator rotates in the clockwise direction, the leading tip of brush *A* comes in contact with commutator segment 2 and shorts coil *b* as indicated in Figure-13b. Similarly, the coil *f* is also short-circuited by brush *B*. The coils *b* and *f* are now undergoing commutation. From Figure-13b it is evident that the current through each brush is still $2I_{c}$. At this instant, the induced emf in coils *b* and *f* are zero because each lies in the plane perpendicular to the flux. However, an instant later, the contacts of brushes *A* and *B* with commutator segment 3 and 7 are broken as depicted in Figure-13c. Coil *b* is now a part of the parallel path formed by coils *c, d* and *e*, and the direction of the current in the coil has reversed. Similarly, coil *f* has become a part of the parallel path formed by coils *a, h* and *g*, and its current has also reversed its direction. The commutation process for coils *b* and *f* is complete. Coils *a* and *e* are now ready for commutation. In a multipole machine, the number of coils undergoing commutation at any instant is equal to the number of parallel paths when the brush width of the commutator segment.
For a commutation process to be perfect, the reversal of current from its value in one direction to an other direction must take place during the time interval $t_{c}$. Otherwise, the excess current (difference of the current in coil $b$ and $c$) prompts a flashover from commutator segment 3 to the trailing tip of brush *A*. Likewise, a flashover also takes place from commutator segment 7 to the trailing tip of brush *B*.
When the current reverses it direction during commutation in a straight-line fashion as illustrated in Figure-12b, the commutation process is said to be linear. A **linear commutation** process is considered to be ideal in the sense that no flashover occurs from the commutator segments to the trailing tips of the brushes. In the next section, we discuss methods that allow us to improve commutation under varying loads.

## 8. Armature Reaction 
When there is no current in the armature winding (a no-load condition), the flux produced by the field winding is uniformly distributed over the pole faces as shown in Figure-14a for a 2-pole dc machine. The induced emf in a coil that lies in the neutral position under no load where the brushes must be positioned for proper commutation.
Let us now assume that the 2-pole dc machine is driven by a prime mover in the clockwise direction and is, therefore, operating as a generator. The direction of the current in the armature conductors under load is shown in Figure-14b. The armature flux distributed due to the armature mmf. Note that the magnetic axis of the armature flux (the quadrature, q-axis) is perpendicular to the magnetic axis of the field-winding flux (direct, or d-axis). Since both fluxes exist at the same time when the armature is loaded, the resultant flux is distorted as indicated in Figure-15c. The armature flux has weakened the flex in one-half of the pole and has strengthened it in the other half. The armature current has, therefore, displaced the magnetic-field axis of the resultant flux in the direction of rotation of the generator. As the neutral plane is perpendicular to the resultant field, it has also advanced. The effect of the armature mmf upon the field distribution is called the **armature reaction**. We can get a better picture of what is taking place in the generator by looking at its developed diagram.
The developed diagram of the flux per pole under no load is shown in Figure-15a. In order to simplify the discussion, let us assume that the conductors are uniformly distributed over the surface of the armature. Then the armature mmf under load has a triangular waveform as depicted in Figure-15b. The flux distribution due to the armature mmf is also a straight line under the pole. If the pole arc is less than $180^o$ electrical, the armature flux has a saddle-shaped curve in the interpolar region due to its higher reluctance. The resultant (total) flux distribution is shown in Figure-15c. The distortion in the flux distribution at load compared with that at no load is evident. If saturation is low, the decrease in the flux in one-half of the pole is accompanied by an equal increase in the flux in the other half. The net flux per pole, therefore, is the same under load as at no load. On the other hand, if the poles were already close to the saturation point under no load, the increase in the flux is smaller than the decrease, as indicated by the dotted line in Figure-15c. In this case, there is a net loss in the total flux. For a constant armature speed, the induced emf in the armature winding decreases owing to the decrease in the flux when the armature is loaded.
As mentioned earlier, the nature plane in the generator moves in the direction of rotation as the armature is loaded. Because the neutral zone is the ideal zone for the coils to undergo commutation, the brushes must be moved accordingly. Otherwise, the forced commutation results in excessive sparking. As the armature flux varies with load load, so does its influence on the flux set up by the field winding. Hence, the shift in the neutral plane is a function of the armature current.
The armature reaction has a demagnetizing effect on the machine. The reduction in the flux due to armature reaction suggests a substantial loss in the applied mmf per pole of the machine. In large machines, the armature reaction may have a devastating effect on the machines performance under full-load. Therefore, techniques must be developed to counter its demagnetizing effect. Some of the measures that are being used to combat armature reaction are summarized below:
1. The brushes may be advanced from their neutral position at no load (geometrical neutral axis) to the new neutral plane under load. This measure is the least expensive. However, it is useful only for constant-load generators.
2. **Interpoles** or **commutating poles** as they are sometimes called, are narrow poles that may be located in the interpole region centered along the mechanical neutral axis of the generator. The interpole windings are permanently loads. The interpole produce flux that opposes the flux due to the armature mmf. When the interpole is properly designed, the flux along the geometrical neutral axis can be brought to zero for any load. Because the interpole winding carries armature current, we need only a few turns of comparatively heavy wire to provides the necessary interpole mmf. Figure 5.16 shows the armature flux distribution with interpoles.
3. Another method to nullify the effect of armature reaction is to make use of **compensating windings**. These windings, which also carry the armature current, are placed in the shallow slots cut in the pole faces as shown in Figure-17. Once again, the flux produced by the compensating winding is made equal and opposite to the flux established by the armature mmf.

## 9. Types of DC Generators 
Based upon the methods of excitation, dc generators can be divided into two classes, Separately excited generators and self-excited generator. A PM generator can be considered a separately excited generator with constant magnetic flux.
The field (excitation) current in a separately excited generator is supplied by an independent external source. However, a self-excited generator provides its own excitation current. According to the method of connection of the field windings, a self-excited generator can be further classified as (a) **a shunt generator** if its field winding, called the shunt field winding, is connected across the armature terminals, (b) **a series generator** when its field winding, called the series field winding, is connected in series with the armature, and (c) **a compound generator** with both shunt and series field windings. We investigate the operation of each type of dc generator by examining its external characteristic under steady-state condition. The **external characteristic** of a dc generator is the variation of the load voltage (**terminal voltage**) with load current. This information enables us to highlight the application for which each generator is mot suitable.]
During out discussion of dc generator we should keep in mind the following facts:
1. The generator is driven by a prime mover, such as s synchronous motor, at a constant speed.
2. The induced emf in the armature winding is proportional to the flux in the machine; that is $E_{a} = K_{a}\Phi_{p} \omega_{m}$.
3. The armature terminals are connected to the load.
4. The armature winding has finite resistance, however small it may be. Therefore, the armature terminal voltage is bound to be lower than the induced emf.
5. If the generator is not compensated for the armature reaction, there is less overall flux in the machine under load than at no load. Thus, the induced emf is lower under load than no load. This result in a further decrease of the terminal voltage.
6. The torque developed by the armature conductors, $T_{d} = K_{a}\Phi_{p}I_{a}$, is equal and opposite to the torque applied by the prime mover. That is, the torque developed opposes the armature rotation.
7. The voltage drop between the brushes and the commutator segments is known as the **brush-contact** drop. If needed and not specified, it may be assumed to be about 2 V.
8. If the pertinent information regarding the adverse effect of armature reaction on generator performance is not known, we assume that either the armature reaction is negligible or the generator is appropriately compensated for it.
9. We commonly use a term called **load** in electrical machines to signify the load-current. Thus, "no load" means an open circuit and "full load" implies the rate load-current at the rated terminal voltage.
## 10. Voltage Regulation 
As the load-current increase, the terminal voltage decreases owing to the increase in the voltage drop across the armature-winding resistance as well as the demagnetizing effect of the armature reaction. The voltage regulation is a measure of the terminal voltage drop at full-load terminal voltage, the **voltage regulation** is defined as 
$$
VR\% = \frac{V_{nL}-V_{fL}}{V_{fL}} \times 100
$$
Where VR% is the percent voltage regulation. For an ideal (constant-voltage) generator, the voltage regulation should be zero. The voltage regulation is considered positive when the terminal voltage at no load is higher than at full load. A negative voltage regulation indicates that the terminal voltage at full load-current is higher than that at no load.

## 11. Losses in DC Machines 
Once again, we are using term machine in the discussion of power losses owing to the fact that no distinction need to made between the losses in the dc generator and the motor. The law of conservation of energy dictates that the input power must be always be equal to the output power plus the losses in the machine. There are three major categories of losses: mechanical losses, copper losses, and magnetic losses.
#### 11.1 Mechanical Losses 
Mechanical losses are the result of (a) the friction between the bearings and the shaft, (b) the friction between the brushes and the commutator, and (c) the drag on the the armature caused by air enveloping the armature (windage loss).
The bearing-friction loss depends upon the diameter of the shaft at the bearing, the shaft's peripheral speed, and the coefficient of friction between the shaft and the bearing. To reduce the coefficient of friction, the bearings are usually lubricated.
The brush-friction loss depends upon the peripheral speed of the commutator, the brush pressure, and the coefficient of friction between the brush and the commutator. The graphite in the brush helps provide lubrication to lessen the coefficient of friction.
The windage loss depends upon the peripheral speed of the armature, the number of slots on its periphery, and its length.
Mechanical losses due to friction and windage $P_{fw}$ can be determined by rotating the armature of an unexcited machine at its rated speed by coupling it to a calibrated motor. Because there is no power output, the supplied to the armature is the mechanical loss.

### 11.2 Magnetic Loss
Since the induced emf in the conductors of the armature alternate withe a frequency determined by the speed of rotation and the number of poles, a magnetic loss $P_{m}$ (hysteresis and the eddy-current) exists in the armature.
The hysteresis loss depends upon the frequency of the induced emf, the area of the hysteresis loop, the magnetic flux density, and the volume of the magnetic material. The area of the hysteresis loop is smaller for soft magnetic materials are used for electrical machines.
Although the armature is built using thin laminations, the eddy-current do appear in each lamination and produced eddy-current loss. The eddy-current loss depends upon the thickness of the lamination, the magnetic flux density, the frequency of the induced emf, and the volume of the magnetic material.
A considerable reduction in the magnetic loss can be obtained by operating the machine in the linear region at a low flux density but at the expense of its size and initial cost.

#### 11.3 Rotational Losses 
In the analysis of a dc machine, it is a common practice to lump the mechanical loss and the magnetic loss together. The sum of the two losses is called the **rotational loss**, $P_{r}$. That is, $P_{r} = P_{fw} + P_{m}$.
The rotational loss of dc machine can be determined by running the machine as a separately excited motor (to be discussed later) under no load. The armature winding voltage should be so adjusted that the induced emf in the armature winding is equal to its rated value, $E_{a}$. If $V_{t}$ is the terminal voltage and $R_{a}$ is the armature-winding resistance, then the voltage that must be applied to the armature terminals is 
$$
V_{a} = V_{t} +I_{a}R_{a}
$$
For the generator and
$$
V_{a} = V_{t}- I_{a}R_{a}
$$
For the motor.
Apply $V_{a}$ across the armature terminals and adjust the field excitation until the machine rotates at its rated speed. Then measure the armature current. Because the armature current under no load is a small, we can neglect the power loss in the armature winding. As there is no power output, the power supplied to the motor, $V_{a}I_{a}$, must be equal to the rotational loss in the machine. By subtracting the mechanical loss, we can determine the magnetic loss in the machine.

#### 11.4 Copper Losses 
Whenever a current flows in a wire, a copper loss, $P_{cu}$, is associated withe it. The copper losses, also known as electrical or $I^2R$ losses, can be segregated as follows:
1. Armature-winding loss. 
2. Shunt field-winding loss.
3. Series field-winding loss.
4. Interpole field-winding loss.
5. Compensating field-winding loss.

#### 11.5 Strays-Load Loss
A machine always has some losses that cannot be easily accounted for; they are termed **stray-load losses**. It is suspected that the stray-load losses in dc machines are the result of (a) the distorted flux due to armature reaction and (b) short-circuit Currents in the coils undergoing commutation. As a rule of thumb, the stray-load
Loss is assumed to be 1% of the power output in large machines (above 100 horse-Power) and can be neglected in small machines. 

#### 11.6 Power-Flow Diagram 
In a dc generator, the mechanical energy supplied to the armature by the prime Mover is converted into electric energy. At the outset, some of the mechanical
Energy is lost as the rotational loss. The mechanical power that is available for Conversion into electrical power is the difference between the power supplied to
The shaft and the rotational loss. We refer to the available power as developed Power. Subtract all the copper losses in the machine from the developed power
To obtain the power output. If $T_{s}$, is the torque at the shaft and $\omega_{m}$, is the angular Velocity of rotation, then the power output, $P_{o}$, for a generator is
$$
P_{o} = T_{s}\omega_{m}- P_{r}-P_{cu}
$$
A typical power-flow diagram for the generator is shown in Figure-18.

#### 11.7 Efficiency 
The efficiency of a machine is simply the ratio of its power output to the power Input. In the case of a separately excited machine, the power lost in the field winding may also be included in the input power when computing the efficiency of the machine.

## 12. A Separately Excited DC Generator
As the name suggests, a separately excited dc generator requires an independent dc external source for the field winding and for this reason is used primarily in
(a) laboratory and commercial testing and (b) special regulation sets. The external source can be another dc generator, a controlled or uncontrolled rectifier, or
simply a battery.
The equivalent circuit representation under steady-state condition of a separately excited dc generator is given in Figure-19. The steady-state condition implies that no appreciable change occurs in either the armature current or the armature speed for a given load. In other words, there is essentially no change in
the mechanical energy or the magnetic energy of the system. Therefore, there is no need to include the inductance of each winding and the inertia of the system
as part of the equivalent circuit. We include these effects when we discuss the dynamics of electric machines in Chapter 11.
In the equivalent circuit, $E_{a}$, is the induced emf in the armature winding, $R_{a}$, is the effective armature-winding resistance which may also include the resistance
of each brush, $I_{a}$, is the armature current, $V_{t}$ , is the terminal output voltage, $I_{L}$, is the load current, $I_{f}$ is the field-winding current, $R_{fw}$ the field-winding resistance, $R_{fx}$ is an external resistance added in series with the field winding to control the field current, $N_{f}$ is the number of turns per pole for the field winding, and $V_{f}$ is the voltage of an external source.
The defining equation under steady-state operation are
$$
V_{f} = I_{f}(R_{fw} +R_{fx}) = I_{f}R_{f}
$$
$$
E_{a} = V_{t} = I_{a}R_{a}
$$
and
$$
I_{l} = I_{a}
$$
Where $R_{f}$ = $R_{fw} + R_{fx}$ is the total resistance in the shunt field-winding circuit.
From Eq. (5.26), the terminal voltage is
$$V_{t} = E_{a}- I_{a}R_{a}$$
When the field current is held constant and the armature is rotating at a constant speed, the induced emf in an ideal generator is independent of the armature current, as shown by the dotted line in Figure 5.20. As the load current $I_{L}$ , increases, the terminal voltage $V_{t}$ , decreases, as indicated by the solid line. In the absence of the armature reaction, the decrease in $V_{t}$ , should be linear and equal to the voltage drop across $R_{a}$,. However, if the generator is operating near its saturation and is not properly compensated for the armature reaction, the armature reaction causes a further drop in the terminal voltage.
A plot of the terminal voltage versus the load current is called the external (terminal) characteristic of a dc generator. The external characteristic can be obtained experimentally by varying the load from no load to as high as 150% of the rated load. The terminal voltage at no load, $V_{nL}$ is, simply $E_{a}$. If we draw a line tangent to the curve at no load, we obtain the terminal characteristic of the machine with no armature reaction. The difference between the no-load voltage and the tangent line yields $I_{a}R_{a}$ drop. Since $I_{a}$, is known, we can experimentally determine the effective armature-winding resistance. The term “effective” signifies that it is not only the resistance of the armature winding but also includes the brush-contact resistance.

## 13. A Shunt Generator
When the field winding of a separately excited generator is connected across the armature, the dc generator is called the shunt generator. In this case, the terminal voltage is also the field-winding (field) voltage. Under no load, the armature current is equal to the field current. When loaded, the armature current supplies the load current and the field current as shown in Figure 5.22. Since the terminal voltage can be very high, the resistance of the field circuit must also be high in order to keep its power loss to a minimum. Thus, the shunt field winding has a large number of turns of relatively fine wire.
As long as some residual flux remains in the field poles, the shunt generator is capable of building up the terminal voltage. The process of voltage buildup is
summarized below.
When the generator is rotating at its rated speed, the residual flux in the field poles, however small it may be (but it must be there), induces an emf E, in the
armature winding as shown in Figure 5.23. Because the field winding is connected across the armature, the induced emf sends a small current through the field
winding. If the field winding is properly connected, its mmf sets up a flux that aids the residual flux. The total flux per pole increases. The increase in the flux
per pole increases the induced emf which, in turn, increases the field current. The action is therefore cumulative. Does this action continue forever? The answer, of
course, is no for the following reason:
The induced emf follows the nonlinear magnetization curve. The current in the field winding depends upon the total resistance in the field-winding circuit. The relation between the field current and the field voltage is linear, and the slope of the curve is simply the resistance in the field-winding circuit. The straight line
is also known as the field-resistance line. The shunt generator continues to build up voltage until the point of intersection of the field-resistance line and the magnetic saturation curve. This voltage is known as the no-load voltage.
It is very important to realize that the saturation of the magnetic material is a blessing in the case of a self-excited generator. Otherwise, the voltage buildup
would continue indefinitely. We will also show that the saturation is necessary for the generator to deliver load.
If the field winding is connected in such a way that the flux produced by its mmf opposes the residual flux, a voltage build-down will occur. This problem can be corrected by either reversing the direction of rotation or interchanging the field-winding connection to the armature terminals, but not both.
The value of no-load voltage at the armature terminals depends upon the field-circuit resistance. A decrease in the field-circuit resistance causes the shunt generator to build up faster to a higher voltage as shown in Figure 5.24. By the same token, the voltage buildup slows down and the voltage level falls when the
field-circuit resistance is increased. The value of the field-circuit resistance that makes the field-resistance line tangent to the magnetization curve is called the critical (field) resistance. The generator voltage will not build up if the field-circuit resistance is greater than or equal to the critical resistance. The speed at which the field circuit resistance becomes the critical resistance is called the critical speed.
Hence, the voltage buildup will take place in a shunt generator if (a) a residual flux exists in the field poles, (b) the field-winding mmf produces the flux that aids
the residual flux, and (c) the field-circuit resistance is less than the critical resistance.
The equations that govern the operation of a shunt generator under steady-state are
$$
I_{a} = I_{L} + I_{f}
$$
$$
V_{t} = I_{f}(R_{fw}- R_{fx}) = I_{f} R_{f}
$$
And
$$
V_{t} = I_{L}R_{L} = E_{a}- I_{a}R_{a}
$$
#### 13.1 The External Characteristic 
Under no load, the armature current is equal to the field current, which is usually a small fractional of the load current. Therefore, the terminal voltage under no-load $V_{nL}$ nearly equal to the induced emf $E_{a}$ owing to the negligible $I_{a}R_{a}$ drop. As the load current increases, the terminal voltage decreases for the following reason :
1. The increase in $I_{a}R_{a}$ drop.
2. The demagnetization effect of the armature reaction.
3. The decrease in the field current due to the drop in the induced emf.
The effect of each of these factors is shown in Figure-25.
For a successful operation, the shunt generator must operate in the saturated region. Otherwise, the terminal voltage under load can fall to zero for the following reason:
Suppose the generator is operating in the linear region and there is a 10% drop in the terminal voltage as soon as the load draws some current. A 10% drop in the terminal voltage results in a 10% drop in the field current which, in turn, reduces the flux by 10%. A 10% reduction in the flux decreases the induced emf by 10% and causes the terminal voltage to fall even further, and so on. Soon the terminal voltage falls to a level (almost zero) that is not able to supply any appreciable load. The saturation of the magnetic material comes to the rescue. When the generator is operating in the saturated region, a 10%drop in the field current may result in only a 2% or 3% drop in the flux, and the system stabilizes at a terminal voltage somewhat lower than V,, but at a level suitable for successful operation.
As the generator is loaded, the load current increases to a point called the break-down point with the decrease in the load resistance. Any further decrease in the load resistance results in a decrease in the load current owing to a very rapid drop in the terminal voltage. When the load resistance is decreased all the way to zero (a short circuit), the field current goes to zero and the current through the short circuit is the ratio of the residual voltage and the armature-circuit resistance.

## 14. A Series Generator 
As the name suggests, the field winding of a series generator is connected in series with the armature and the external circuit. Because the series field winding has to carry the rated load current, it usually has few turns of heavy wire. 
The equivalent circuit of a series generator is given in Figure 5.27. A variable resistance $R_{d}$, known as the series field diverter, may be connected in shunt withe the series field winding to control the current through and thereby the flux produced by it.
When the generator is operating under no load, the flux produced by the series field winding is zero. Therefore, the terminal voltage of the generator is equal to the induced emf due to the residual flux, $E_{r}$. As soon as the generator supplies a load current, the mmf of the series field winding produces a flux that aids the residual flux. Therefore, the induced emf, $E_{a}$, in the armature winding is higher when the generator delivers power than that at no load. However, the terminal voltage, $V_{t}$, is lower than the induced emf due to (a) the voltage drops across the armature resistance, $R_{a}$, the series field-winding resistance, $R_{s}$, and (b) the demagnetization action of the armature reaction. Since voltage drops across the resistances and the armature reaction are functions of the load current, the induced emf and thereby the terminal voltage depend upon the load current. 
The magnetization curve for the series generator is obtained by separately exciting the series field winding. The terminal voltage corresponding to each point on the magnetization curve is less by the amount equal to voltage drops across $R_{a}$, and $R_{s}$, when the armature reaction is zero. The terminal voltage drops even further when the armature reaction is also present as illustrated in Figure 5.28. Once the load current pushes the generator into the saturated region, any further increase in its value makes the armature reaction so great as to cause the terminal voltage to drop sharply. In fact, if driven to its extreme, the terminal voltage may drop to zero.
The rising characteristic of a series generator makes it suitable for voltage-boosting purposes. Another clear distinction between a shunt generator and a series generator is that the shunt generator tends to maintain a constant terminal voltage while the series generator has a tendency to supply constant load current. In Europe, the Thury system of high-voltage direct-current power transmission requires several series generators connected in series and transmitting at constant
current.
The basic equations that govern its steady-state operation are
$$
V_{t} = E_{a}- I_{a}R_{a}- I_{s}R_{s}
$$
$$
I_{s}R_{s} = I_{d}R_{d}
$$
$$
I_{a} = I_{L} = I_{s} + I_{d}
$$
Where $I_{s}$ is the current in the series field winding, $R_{s}$ is the resistance of the series field winding and $I_{d}$ is the current in the series field--diverter resistance, $R_{d}$.

## 15. Compound Generators 
The drooping characteristic of a shunt generator and the rising characteristic of a series generator provide us enough motivation to theorize the possibility of a better external characteristic by fusing the two generators into one. In fact, under certain constraints, putting the two generators together is like transforming two contentiously different generators into a single well-behaved generator. This is done by winding both series and shunt field windings on each pole of the generator. When the mmf of the series field is aiding the mmf of the shunt field, it is referred to as a cumulative compound generator (Figure 5.29a). Otherwise, it is termed a differential compound generator (Figure 5.29b).
When the shunt field winding is connected directly across the armature terminals, it is called a short-shunt generator. In a short-shunt generator (Figure 5.30), the series field winding carries the load current in the absence of a field diverter resistance. A generator is said to be long shunt when the shunt field winding is across the load as indicated in Figure 5.31. We hasten to add that most of the flux is created by the shunt field. The series field mainly provides a control over the total flux. Therefore, different levels of compounding can be obtained by limiting the current through the series field, as explained in Section 5.14. Three distinct degrees of compounding that are of considerable interest are discussed below.

#### 15.1 Undercompound Generator
When the full-load voltage in a compound generator is somewhat higher than that of a shunt generator but still lower than the no-load voltage, it is called an undercompound generator. The voltage regulation is slightly better than that of the shunt generator.

#### 15.2 Flat or Normal Compound Generator 
When the no-load voltage is equal to the full-load voltage, the generator is known as a flat compound generator. A flat compound generator is used when the distance between the generator and the load is short. In other words, no significant voltage drop occurs on the transmission line (called the feeder) connecting the generator to the load.

#### 15.3 Overcompound Generator 
When the full-load voltage is higher than the no-load voltage, the generator is said to be overcompound. An overcompound generator is the generator of choice when the generator is connected to a load via a long transmission line. The long transmission line implies a significant drop in voltage and loss in power over the transmission line.
The usual practice is to design an overcompound generator. The adjustments can then be made by channeling the current away from the series field winding by using the field diverter resistance.
The external characteristics of compound generators are given in Figure 5.32. For comparison purposes, the external characteristics of other generators are also
included.
The fundamental equations that govern the steady-state behavior of short-shunt and long-shunt cumulative generators are given below.
Short-shunt:
$$
I_{a} = I_{L} + I_{f}
$$
$$
I_{s} = \frac{R_{d}}{R_{d} + R_{s}}I_{L}
$$
$$
V_{t} = E_{a}- I_{a}R_{a}- I_{s}R_{s}
$$
$$
V_{f} = E_{a}-I_{a}R_{a}
$$
$$
\text{mmf} = I_{f}N_{f} \pm I_{s}N_{s}- \text{mmf}_{d}
$$
Where the (plus/minus) sign is for the (cumulative/differential) compound generator, and $\text{mmf}_{d}$ is the demagnetizing mmf due to armature reaction 
Long-shunt:
$$
I_{a} = I_{L} + I_{f}
$$
$$
I_{s} = \frac{R_{d}}{R_{d} + R_{s}}I_{a}
$$
$$
V_{f} = V_{t} = E_{a}- I_{a}R_{a}- I_{s}R_{s}
$$
$$
\text{mmf} = I_{f}N_{f} \pm I_{s}N_{s}- \text{mmf}_{d}
$$
