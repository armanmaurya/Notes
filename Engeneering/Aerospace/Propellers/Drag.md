  - Air Resistance

Whenever a body is moved through air, or other viscous fluid, a definite resistance to its motion is produced. In aeronautical work this resistance is usually referred to as **drag or Air resistance**.

**Drag is the enemy of flight**, and efforts must be made to reduce the resistance of every part of an aeroplane to a minimum, provided strength and other essential factors can be maintained. For this reason many thousands of experiments have been carries out to investigate the problem of air resistance; in fact, in this, as in almost every branch of the subject, our knowledge is founded mainly on the mean result of accumulated experimental data.

Drags are of Two types:-
1. **Form drag** or **Pressure drag**
2. **Skin friction** or **Surface friction**
