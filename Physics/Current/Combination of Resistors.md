# Combination of Resistors
We can connect resistors in two ways are:-
1. [[#Series Combination]]
2. [[#Parallel Combination]]

## Series Combination 
A number of resistance are said to be connected in series, if they are joined end to end and the **same current** flows through each one of them, when a potential difference is applied across the combination.

The equivalent or resultant resistance is equal to the sum of individual resistance and resultant resistance is greater than the greatest resistance in the combination.

If $n$ resistance each of value $R$ are connected in series, the equivalent resistance $R_{e}$ is given by, $$R_{e}= nR = \text{Number of resistance} \times \text{Resistance of Resistor}$$
Equal current flows through each resistance and it is also equal to the total current in the circuit.

The potential difference across the ends of the combination is distributed across the ends of each of the resistances. The potential difference across any one of the resistance is directly proportional to its resistance.

When two or more resistance are joined in series, the result is the same as increasing the length of the conductor. In both cases the resultant resistance is higher.

## Parallel Combination 
When a number of resistance are connected in parallel, the reciprocal of the equivalent or resultant resistance is equal to the sum of reciprocals of the individual resistance and Resultant resistance is always is smaller than the smallest resistance in combination. $$\frac{1}{R_{e}} = \frac{1}{R_{1}}+ \frac{1}{R_{2}} + \frac{1}{R_{3}}$$

If there are $n$ resistances connected in parallel and each resistance has a value of $R$ then resultant resistance is equal to,
$$
R_{e} = \frac{R}{n} = \frac{\text{Resistance of each resistor}}{\text{number of resistors}}
$$
The potential difference across each resistance is the same and is equal to the total potential difference across the combination.

The total current divides itself and different current flows through each resistor. The maximum current flows through the resistor having minimum resistance and vice versa.

If an equivalent resistance $R_{e}$ is connected in place of combination, it produces the same current for the same potential difference applied across its ends.

If two resistance $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are connected in parallel then, equivalent resistance is, $$R_{e} = \frac{R_{1}R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}$$
