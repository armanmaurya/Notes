**Resistivity** is a fundamental property of materials that measures how strongly they resist the flow of electric current. It is often denoted by the symbol **ρ** (rho) and is expressed in **ohm meters (Ω·m)**.
### Key points:
1. **Formula**: The resistivity of a material is related to its resistance $R$, length $L$, and cross-sectional area $A$ by the equation:
   $$
   \rho = R \cdot \frac{A}{L}
   $$
2. **Temperature Dependency**: For most materials, resistivity increases with temperature, as the atoms vibrate more and impede the flow of electrons.
   
3. **Materials**:
   - **Conductors** (e.g., copper, aluminum): Low resistivity, allowing easy flow of electric current.
   - **Insulators** (e.g., rubber, glass): High resistivity, restricting current flow.
   - **Semiconductors** (e.g., silicon, germanium): Resistivity can be altered by doping and external factors like temperature or electric fields.

4. **Applications**: Resistivity helps determine how suitable a material is for use in electrical applications, such as wiring, resistors, or semiconductors.

It's a critical property in fields like electronics, material science, and electrical engineering.
