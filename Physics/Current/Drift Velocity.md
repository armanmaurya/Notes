**Drift Velocity** ($v_d$) refers to the average velocity that charged particles, such as electrons, attain when an electric field is applied. In a conductor, free electrons move randomly due to thermal energy, but under the influence of an electric field, they drift toward the positive terminal, resulting in the flow of [Electric Current](Electric%20Current.md).
### Formula for Drift Velocity
##### In Term of [Electric Current](Electric%20Current.md)
$$
V_d = \frac{I}{nAq}
$$
Where:
- $I$ = current,
- $n$ = number of charge carriers per unit volume,
- $A$ = cross-sectional area of the conductor,
- $q$ = charge of each carrier (for electrons, itâ€™s the elementary charge).

##### In Term of [Electric Field](../Electrostatics/Electric%20Field.md)
$$
V_d = \mu E
$$
Where:
-  $\mu$ = mobility of the charge carriers,
- $E$ = electric field strength.

#### Mobility

Mobility ($\mu$) is defined as:

$$
\mu = \frac{q \tau}{m}
$$

Where:
- $q$ = charge of the carrier,
- $\tau$ = mean free time between collisions (relaxation time),
- $m$ = mass of the charge carrier.

#### Final Drift Velocity Expression
Thus, drift velocity in terms of the electric field can be expressed as:

$$
V_d = \frac{q \tau E}{m}
$$
### Key Points
- Drift velocity is typically very small (around millimeters per second).
- Electric signals propagate quickly through a conductor due to electromagnetic waves, not the actual movement of electrons.
- The concept of drift velocity is essential for understanding how electric current flows in circuits.
