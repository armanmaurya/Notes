- Rate of flow of [Electric Charge](../Electrostatics/Electric%20Charge.md)
- It is a scalar quantity.
- Unit is Ampere
## Average Electric Current
Value of average [Electric Current](Electric%20Current.md) is Total [Electric Charge](../Electrostatics/Electric%20Charge.md) charge flown divided by Total time.
$$
\text{Average Electric Current} = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta T}
$$
## Instantaneous Electric Current
Instantaneous [Electric Current](Electric%20Current.md) can be obtained by 
$$
dI= \frac{dq}{dt}
$$

#### Current Due to [Drift Velocity](Jee/Physics/Current/Drift%20Velocity.md):-
Current is developed due to [Drift Velocity](Drift%20Velocity.md), and value of current is :
$$
I = neAV_{d}
$$
Where,
$\large n$ = no. Of free electron per unit volume
$\large e$ = charge on electron
$A$ = Area of Cross-section of conductor 
$V_{d}$ = Drift Velocity
