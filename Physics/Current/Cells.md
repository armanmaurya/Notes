A cell converts chemical energy into electrical energy.

## EMF Produced by Cell
It depends on:-
- Nature of electrolyte
- Metal of electrodes

If doesn't depends on:-
- Area of plates
- Distance between the electrodes.
- Quantity of electrolyte.
- Size of cell

## Internal Resistance of Cell
Resistance offered by the electrolyte of the cell when an electric current flows through it, is knows as internal resistance.
It depends On:-
- Distance between two electrodes $\propto$ Resistance
- Area dipped in electrolyte $\propto$ $\frac{1}{\text{Resistance}}$ 
- Concentration of electrolyte $\propto$ Resistance 
- Temperature $\propto \frac{1}{\text{Resistance}}$

## Voltage Across Cell
Voltage can be calculated in two conditions:-
1. Open Circuit 
2. Closed Circuit

**Open Circuit:-**
In Open circuit Voltage is equal to the Emf of Cell. $$V_{across} = E.M.F$$

**Closed Circuit:-**
In Closed circuit voltage across cell is equal to, 
In Case of Discharging:-
$$V_{across}= E.M.F- Ir$$
In Case of Charging:-
$$V_{across} = E.F.F+Ir$$
Where,
- $r$ is internal resistance 
- $I$ is Current in circuit.
