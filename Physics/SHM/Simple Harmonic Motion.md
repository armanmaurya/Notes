It is a type of [Oscillatory Motion](Oscillatory%20Motion.md) of constant amplitude and of single frequency under a restoring force whose magnitude is proportional to the displacement and always acts towards mean Position is called Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM).

A simple harmonic oscillation can be expressed as
$$
y = a\sin \omega t
$$
Or 
$$
y = a\cos \omega t
$$
Where, a = amplitude of oscillation.

## Mean Position:-
At mean position:
$$
a= 0 \quad, \quad F_{net}=0 \quad, \quad V=max
$$

## Amplitude:-
It is the maximum displacement from mean position. At maximum Amplitude $V=0$
$$
\text{Amplitude} = x_{max}- x_{mean}
$$

### Phase and Initial Phase:-
$$
x = A\sin(\omega t + \phi)
$$
**Phase ($\omega t+\phi$):-** it governs the state of motion .
**Initial Phase ($\phi$):-** It governs the initial phase of motion.

## Velocity :
$$
V= V_{max}\sqrt{ 1- \frac{x^2}{A^2} }
$$
$$
V = \omega \sqrt{ A^2-x^2 }
$$
