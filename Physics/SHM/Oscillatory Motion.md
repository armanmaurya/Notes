A [Periodic Motion](Periodic%20Motion.md) taking place to and fro or back and forth about a fixed point, is called oscillatory motion, e.g., motion of a simple pendulum, motion of a loaded spring etc.

Note Every oscillatory motion is periodic motion but every periodic motion is not oscillatory motion.
