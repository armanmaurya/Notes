The linear mass density of a one-dimensional body is its mass (M) per unit length (L).

### Uniform Mass Distribution
Consider a long, thin rod of mass $M$ and length $L$. To calculate the average linear mass density, $\lambda_{m}$ of this one dimensional object, we can simply divide the total mass, $M$ by the total length, $L$:
$$\lambda_{m} = \frac{M}{L}$$
### Non-Uniform Mass Distribution

If we describe the rod as having a varying mass (one that varies as a function of position along the length of the rod, $l$), we can write:
$$m = m(l)$$
Each extremely small unit of mass, $dm$, is equal to the product of its linear mass density, $\lambda_{m}$, and the extremely small unit of length, $dl$: 
$$dm = \lambda_{m}dl$$

The linear mass density can then be understood as the derivative of mass function with respect to the one dimension of the rod (the position along its length, $l$)
$$\lambda_{m} = \frac{dm}{dl}$$
The **SI** unit of linear mass density is the **kilogram per meter (kg/m)**.
