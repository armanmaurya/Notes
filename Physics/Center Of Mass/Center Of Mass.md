For a system of particles center of mass is that point at which its total mass is supposed to be concentrated. The center of mass of an object is a point that represents the entire body and moves in the same way as a point mass having mass equal to that of the object, when subjected to the same external forces that act on the object.

### Center of mass of system of discrete particles
Total mass of the body : $M = m_{1}+m_{2}+\dots+m_{n}$
Then, 
$$\vec{R}_{CM} = \frac{m_{1}\vec{r}_{1} + m_{2}\vec{r}_{2} + m_{3}\vec{r}_{3} +\dots}{m_{1}+m_{2}+m_{3}+\dots}$$
Co-ordinates of center of mass:
$$x_{cm}=\frac{1}{M}\Sigma m_{i}x_{i} \quad, \quad y_{cm} = \frac{1}{M}\Sigma m_{i}y_{i} \quad, \quad z_{cm} = \frac{1}{M}\Sigma m_{i}z_{i}$$
### Center of mass of continuous distribution of particles
If the system has continuous distribution of mass, treating the mass element $dm$ at position $\vec{\text{r}}$ as a point mass and replacing summation by integration.
$$\vec{R}_{CM} = \frac{1}{M}\int \vec{\text{r}} \, dm $$
So that,
$$x_{cm} = \frac{1}{M}\int x \, dm \quad, \quad y_{cm} = \frac{1}{M}\int y \, dm  \quad, \quad z_{cm} = \frac{1}{M}\int z \, dm $$
