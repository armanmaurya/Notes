A current in the conductor produces a [Magnetic Field](../Magnetic%20Field.md). Maxwell proved that a changing [Electric Field](../Electrostatics/Electric%20Field.md) in vacuum or in dielectric also produces [Magnetic Field](../Magnetic%20Field.md). So, a changing [Electric Field](../Electrostatics/Electric%20Field.md) is equivalent to a current which flows as long as the [Electric Field](../Electrostatics/Electric%20Field.md) is changing and produces the same [Magnetic Field](../Magnetic%20Field.md) effect as an ordinary conduction current. This is know as displacement current.

Displacement current is defined as the rate of change of electric displacement field.
Maxwell's equation includes displacement current that proves the Ampere Circuit Law. It is measured in Ampere.
### Current In Capacitor
A charging capacitor has no conduction of charge but the charge accumulation in the capacitor changes the electric field link with the capacitor that in turn produces the current called the Displacement Current.
