Surface Integral of the [Vector](../../Maths/Vectors/Vector.md) field **P** over the closed surface is equal to the volume integral of the divergence of the [Vector](../../Maths/Vectors/Vector.md) over the closed surface. It can be mathematically represented by:
$$
\int _{s} \vec{P}. \, d\vec{S} = \int _{v} (\vec{\nabla}.\vec{P})  \, dV  
$$
Where:
- $\nabla.\vec{F}$ is the divergence of $\vec{F}$, is defined as:
  $$\nabla.\vec{F} = \partial \frac{F_{1}}{\partial x} + \partial \frac{F_{2}}{\partial y} + \partial \frac{F_{3}}{\partial z}$$
