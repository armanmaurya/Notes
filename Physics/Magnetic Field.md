A magnetic field ($\vec{B}$) is a vector field in physics that describes the magnetic influence on charged particles in motion and magnets. It is characterized by its strength, direction, and the spatial distribution of magnetic forces. The direction of the magnetic field at any point is defined by the orientation a small magnetic north pole would take if placed at that point, and the strength is typically measured in units of Tesla or Gauss.
