The quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of the whole of that substance through 1Â°C is called heat capacity. The heat capacity of mass m of the whole substance of [specific heat](Specific%20Heat%20Capacity.md) (s) is = ms
$$
\text{Thermal capacity} = \text{mass} \times \text{specific heat}
$$
Heat capacity depends on property of material of the body and mass of the body.
