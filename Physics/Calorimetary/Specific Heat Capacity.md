It is the amount of  required to raise the temperature of **unit mass** of that substance by 1Â°C (1 K) is called specific heat. It is represented by s or c.
If the temperature of a substance of mass m changes from T to T + dT when it exchanges an amount of heat dQ with its surroundings then its specific heat is,
$$
c = \frac{dQ}{m.dT} = \frac{\Delta Q}{m\Delta T}
$$
