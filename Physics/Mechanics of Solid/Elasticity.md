The Property of Material to regain its initial Shape & Size After Removal of deforming force is known as Elasticity.
Let take a Solid Cylinder with length $l_{o}$, we apply force *F* at both end of Cylinder, perpendicular to its Area as $a_{com} = 0$, and the length of Cylinder is changed by $\Delta l_{o}$ by the Force *F*. It can be elongation force or compression force. When the this force *F* is removed then cylinder try of regain it Shape and Size.
### Stress 
**Breaking Stress** 
Minimum amount of stress a elastic material can withstand before it permanently deforms.

**Elastic limit** 
Maximum amount of stress a material can withstand before it permanently deforms.

**Normal or Longitudinal Stress**
It is defined as Restoring Force per unit Area.
$$
\text{Stess} = \frac{\text{Restoring force}}{\text{Area}}
$$
If the acceleration of body is zero then Restoring force = external force. So,
$$
\text{Stress} = \frac{F_{ext}}{\text{Area}}
$$
### Strain
###### Longitudinal Strain 
$$
\text{Strain} = \frac{\text{Change in Lenght}}{\text{Original Lenght}} = \frac{\Delta l}{l_{o}}
$$

### Hook's Law 
The strain in a solid is proportional to the applied stress within the elastic limit of that solid.
$$
\text{Stress} \propto Strain
$$
$$
\text{Stress} = Y. Strain
$$
$$
\boxed{\frac{F}{A} = Y \frac{\Delta l}{l_{o}}}
$$
Where, $Y$ is young's modulus of elasticity
- Elastic behavior of body is more if the its Young's modules is more. ($Y \uparrow = \text{elastic behavior}\uparrow$)
### Important Results 

For Finding the total Elongation ($\Delta l$) in Rope will mass (M) When hung vertically.
$$
\Delta l = \frac{mgL}{2AY}
$$
Where $m$ is the mass total mass of Rope, $L$ is the length of Rope, $A$ is the Area of cross section, $Y$ is the young's modules.
