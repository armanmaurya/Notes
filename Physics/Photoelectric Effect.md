# Photoelectric Effect
---
When light shines on a metal, electrons can be ejected from the surface of metal this phenomenon know as the *photoelectric effect*. This process is also often referred to as *photoemission*, and the electron that are ejected from metal are called photoelectrons. In terms of their behavior and their properties, photoelectrons are no different from other electrons. The prefix, photo-, simply tells us that the electrons have been ejected from a metal surface by incident light.
## Key Point
- Based on the wave model of light, physicists predicted that increasing light amplitude would increase the kinetic energy of emitted photoelectrons, while increasing the frequency would increase measured current.
- Contrary to the predictions, experiments showed that increasing the light frequency increased the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons, and increasing the light amplitude increased the current.
- Based on these findings, Einstein proposed that light behaved like a stream of particles called _photons_ with an energy of $E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$
- The work function, $\phi$, is the minimum amount of energy required to induce photoemission of electrons from a metal surface, and the value of- ‍  depends on the metal.
- The energy of the incident photon must be equal to the sum of the metal's work function and the photoelectron kinetic energy:

# Light frequency and the threshold $v_{o}$
---
We can think of the incident light as a stream of photons with an energy determined by the light frequency. When a photon hits the metal surface, the photon's energy is absorbed by an electron in the metal.

If the incident light has a frequency less than a minimum frequency $v_{o}$, then no electrons are ejected regardless of the light amplitude. This minimum frequency is also called threshold frequency, and the value of $v_{o}$ depends on the metal. For greater than $v_{o}$, electrons would be ejected from the metal. Furthermore, the kinetic energy of photoelectrons was proportional to the light frequency. The relationship between photoelectrons kinetic energy and light frequency is that, when frequency of light greater than threshold frequency then the electrons will ejected will have higher kinetic energy and current remain constant because number of electrons ejected is not dependent on frequency of electrons. If at low frequency (greater than threshold frequency) 3 electrons are ejected then at higher frequency 3 electrons will eject but at higher kinetic energy.
