## Straight Wire
Magnetic field by Straight wire is at Point $P$
$$
B= \frac{\mu_{o}i}{4\pi d}(\sin \alpha + \sin \beta)
$$
Where,
- $d$ is the distance between the Point $P$ and Wire.
- $\alpha,\beta$ is the angle from Point $P$ to both ends of wire respectively.

**Various Cases:**
1. Point lying on the perpendicular bisector of the wire. $$B=\frac{\mu_{o}i}{2\pi d}\sin \theta$$
2. Point lying on the perpendicular of one end when the other end is infinitity long. $$B=\frac{\mu_{o}i}{4\pi d}$$
3. Magnetic field at a distance $d$ from a infinitely long wire $$\frac{\mu_{o}i}{2\pi d}$$

## Circular Loop
**At Centre:-**
$$
\frac{\mu_{o}i}{2R}
$$
The direction of the $\vec{B}$ field is perpendicular to the plane of the circular loop and given by the right hand rule.

**At Axial:-**
$$
B=\frac{\mu_{o}R^2i}{2(x^2+R^2)^{3/2}}
$$
> Magnetic field at the centre of a circular arc subtending angle $\theta$ at the centre = $\cfrac{\mu_{o}i}{2R}\left( \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \right)$
