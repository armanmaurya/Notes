Gears are used to transmit torque and motion of constant ratio from one shaft to another (there are noncircular gears which are used to transmit nonuniform motion, such as elliptical gears. Noncircular gears are beyond the topic of this chapter). Gears can transmit large torque and they can be made compact.

Kinematically, gear is a form closed kinematic pair with two degrees-of-freedom that is used to join two links. In everyday usage gear refers to a rigid body which has toothed kinematic elements to form a gear pair. One can utilise both meanings as long as there is no confusion. Since a gear pair is form closed, there is a constant speed ratio between the links. Due to these characteristics they are also called "***~={yellow}positive drive=~***" mechanisms in contrast to friction drives such as rollers and belt drives.
