Gear trains are called **_"linear_ _mechanical_ _systems_**_"_ which have combination of [Gears](Gears.md),since the angular relationship between the links can be expressed in terms of a linear function. Other linear mechanical systems are belts (flat, V-belt, timing belt), rollers and chain drives. These mechanical systems can also be kinematically analysed using the methods that will be discussed in this section. However, in case of friction drives, one must assume that there is no slippage and one must neglect the velocity pulsation in case of chain drives. Direction of rotation of the links (gears) may be clockwise or counter-clockwise. In spatial gear trains, however, this convention may also be misleading. In such cases arrows may be used on the figure to indicate the direction of rotation of each link. In gear trains sometimes it is necessary to employ positive and negative signs for speed to indicate that the speed is in the same or opposite sense from some preselected direction (e.g. input speed direction). Usually the direction will not be indicated by the equations and must be obtained by the inspection of the mechanism.
