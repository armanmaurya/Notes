In compressible flow the relative changes in the fluid density are considerable and cannot be neglected. The fluid velocities is such flow are appreciable compared to the local velocity of sound. If the [Mach Number](../Mach%20Number.md) in a flow is higher than $0.3$ it is considered to be compressible.
# Approach 
---
- Control volume approach 
- Steady, One-dimension, Uniform Flow
- Additional Thermodynamics Concepts are needed
- Restrict out analysis to ideal gases

# Question Approach
---
Needed :
- Rpm
- Pressure ratio
- Isentropic efficiency
- Slip factor 
- Absolute velocity at inlet
- Diameter of impeller eye
