This Note Consists essentially of four parts:

1. The kinematics of gear teeth and gear trains. In this part we shall learn something about the shape of the gear tooth itself, together with the problems caused by this shape and what to do about them. We shall also learn about the speed ratio of various kinds of gear trains. Students who have taken course in a mechanisms or kinematics of machines should use this part of the chapter as a review and a reintroduction to the nomenclature of gearing and pass on the other parts.
2. The force analysis of gears and gear trains.
3. The design, that is, determination of the size, of gears based on the strength of the material used.
4. The design of gears based on wear considerations.
# 1. Nomenclature

_**Spur gears**_ are used to transmit rotary motion between parallel shafts; they are usually cylindrical in shape, and the teeth are straight and parallel to the axis of rotation.

The terminology of gear teeth is illustrated in Fig-1. **The _pitch circle_ is a theoretical circle upon which all calculation are usually based.** The pitch circles of a pair of mating gears are tangent to each other. A **pinion** is the smaller of two mating gears. The larger is often called the gear.

The _**circular pitch p**_ is the distance, measured on the pitch circle, from a point on one tooth to a corresponding point on an adjacent tooth. Thus the circular pitch is equal to the sum of the _**tooth thickness**_ and the _**width of space.**_

The **module m** is the radio of the pitch diameter to the number of teeth. The customary unit of length used is the millimeter. The module is the index of tooth size in SI.

A pair of meshing gears, consisting of a pinion and gear, must have exactly the same module, of course, to mesh properly. Since each module requires a separate cutting tool, only finite number of modules have been standardized. See Table-2.

The **addendum a** is the radial distance between the top land and the pitch circle. The **dedendum b** is the radial distance from the bottom land to the pitch circle. The whole depth h$_t$ is the sum of the addendum and dedendum.

The _**clearance circle**_ is a circle that is tangent to the addendum circle of the mating gear. The **clearance c** is the amount by which the dedendum is a given gear exceeds the addendum of its mating gear. The backlash is the amount by which the width of a tooth space exceeds the thickness of the engaging tooth measured on the pitch circles.

You should prove for yourself the validity of the following useful relations :
$$
m = \frac{d}{N}
$$
Where, *m* = module (mm), *d* = pitch diameter (mm), *N* = number of teeth
$$p = \frac{\pi d}{N} = \pi m$$

Where, $p = \text{circular pitch, mm}$

## 2. Conjugate Action 
The following discussion assumes the teeth to be perfectly formed, perfectly smooth, and absolutely rigid. Such an assumption is, of course, unrealistic, because the application of forces will cause deflections.
Mating gear teeth acting against each other to produce rotary motion are similar to cams. When the tooth profiles, or cams, are designed so as to produce a constant angular-velocity ratio during meshing, they are said to have *conjugate action*. In theory, at least it is possible arbitrarily to select any profile for one tooth and then to find a profile for the meshing tooth with will give conjugate action. One of these solutions is the *involute profile*, which with few exception, is in universal use for gear teeth and is the only one with which we shall be concerned.
When one curved surface pushes against another (Fig-2), the point of contact occurs where the two surface are tangent to each other (point *c*), and the forces at any instant are directed along the common normal *ab* to the two curves. The line *ab*, representing the direction of action of the forces, is called the line of action. The line of action will intersect the line of centers O-O at some point *P*. The angular-velocity ratio between the two arms is inversely proportional to their radii to the point *P*. Circles drawn through point *P* from each center are called *pitch circles*, and the radius of each circles is called the *pitch radius*. Point *P* is called the *pitch point*.
To transmit motion at a constant angular-velocity ratio, the pitch point must remain fixed; that is all the lines of action for every instantaneous point of contact must pass through the same point *P*. In the case of the involute profile it will be shown that all points of contact occur on the same straight line *ab*, that all normal to the tooth profiles at the point of contact coincide with the line *ab*, and thus, that these profiles transmit uniform rotary motion.

## 3. Involute Properties 
An involute curve may be generated as shown in Fig-3a. A partial flange *B* is attached to the cylinder *A*, around which is wrapped a cord *def* which is held tightly. Point *b* on the cord represents the tracing point, and as the cord is wrapped and unwrapped about the cylinder, point *b* will trace out the involute at point *a* and a maximum at point *c*. At point *b* the radius is equal to the distance *be* since point *b* is instantaneously rotating about point *e*. Thus the generating line *de* is normal to the involute at all points of intersection and, at the same time, is always tangent to the cylinder *A*. The circle on which the involute is generated is called *base circle*.
Let us now examine the involute profile to see how it satisfies the requirement for the transmission of uniform motion. In Fig-3b two gear blanks with fixed centers at $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$ are shown having base circles whose respective radii are $O_{1}a$ and $O_{2}b$. We now imagine that a cord is wound clockwise around the base circle of gear 1, pulled tightly between points *a* and *b*, and wound counterclockwise around the base circle of gear 2. If, now, the base circles are rotated in different directions so as to keep the cord tight, a point *g* on the cord will trace out the involutes *cd* on gear 1 and *ef* on gear 2. The involutes are thus generated simultaneously by the tracing point. The tracing point, therefore, represents the point of contact, while the portion of the cord *ab* is the generated line. The point of position because it is always tangent to the base circles, and since the generated line is always normal to the involutes at the point of contact, the requirement for uniform motion is satisfied.
