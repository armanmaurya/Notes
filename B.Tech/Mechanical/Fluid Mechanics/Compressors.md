A compressor is a machine that increases the pressure of a gas by reducing its volume.

There are two main types of compressors are:-
1. Positive Displacement compressor 
2. Dynamic Compressors
	1. [Centrifugal Compressors](Centrifugal%20Compressors/Centrifugal%20Compressors.md) 
	2. Axial Compressors

# Application

**Centrifugal compressor:**
- Ideal for moderate to high-pressure application (around 5-7 pressure ratio per stage)
- Commonly used in superchargers for car engines, oil and gas refineries, and industrial air compressors due to their simpler design and ease of maintenance.
- [Learn in Detail](Centrifugal%20Compressors/Centrifugal%20Compressors.md) 

**Axial Compressors:**
- More suited for high volume flow rates at moderate pressure increases (less than 1.5 pressure ratio per stage)
- Found in jet engines, gas turbine power plants, and high-performance industrial applications due to their efficiency and ability to handle large airflows.
