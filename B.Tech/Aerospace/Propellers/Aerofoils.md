Aerofoils are specially shaped structures that generate lift when they move through a fluid (usually air). They are the fundamental building blocks for wings on, airplanes, sails on boats, propellers, and even wind turbine blades.
## Lifting Surface
---
If air flows past an aerofoils, a flat plate or indeed almost any shape that is inclined to the direction of flow, we find that the pressure of air on the top surface is reduced while that underneath is increased. This difference in pressure result in a net force on the plate trying to push it both upwards and backwards. In the case of a simple flat plate, you might imagine that the net force would act at right angle to the plate. This is not so true, because there is also a tangential force caused by the different pressures that act on the small leading and trailing edge face areas. This tangential force, through small, is by no means negligible. Rather surprisingly, **the pressure at the leading edge is normally very low, and at small angles of inclination, the tangential force will act in the direction shown.** Note, that although the tangential force may be directed towards the front of the plate, the resultant of the tangential and normal forces must always be tilted back relative to the local flow direction.
## Lift and Drag

The resultant or net force on the lifting surface may be conveniently split into two components relative to the airflow direction as follows--
1. **The component at right angles to the direction of the airflow,** called **LIFT** 
2. **The component paraller to the direction of the airflow**, called **DRAG**
## Why Curved Aerofoil ?
---
It was soon discovered that a much greater lift, especially when compared with the drag, could be produced by using a curved surface instead of flat one, and thus the modern aerofoil was evolved. The curved surface has the additional advantage that it provide a certain amount of thickness, which was necessary for structural strength.
**Experiments have shown that air flows over aerofoil much more smoothly than over flat plate.** 
## Airflow and pressure over aerofoil

![Airflow over an aerofoil inclined at a small angle| fill](../../Mechanical/Fluid%20Dynamics/Images/Airflow%20over%20an%20aerofoil%20inclined%20at%20a%20small%20angle.jpg)
In Fig., which shows the flow over an aerofoil, the following results should be noticed--

1. **There is a slight upflow before passing the aerofoils.**
2. **There is a downflow after passing the aerofoil.** This downflow should not be confused with downwash produced by the trailing described later.
3. **The air does not strike the aerofoil cleanly on the nose, but actually divides at a point just behind it on the underside.**
4. **The [Streamlines](Streamlines.md) are closer together above the aerofoil where the pressure is decreased.**

This last point may lead us to that the air above the aerofoil is compressed, and that therefore we should expect an increased pressure. The explanation is that the air over the top surface acts as though it were passing through a kind of bottleneck, similar to a venturi tube, and therefore its velocity must increase at the portions, i.e., at the highest points of the curved aerofoil.**
**The increase in kinetic energy due to the increase in velocity is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in static pressure.**
## Chord line & Angle of attack
---
- The **chord** is usually take as the line joining the leading edge to the trailing edge. 
- The angle between the chord of the aerofoil and the direction of the airflow is the **angle of attack.** We shall consider the direction of the airflow to be that of the air stream at such a distance that it is undisturbed by the presence of the aerofoil.

## Pressure Plotting
---
As the angle of attack is altered the lift and drag change very rapidly and experiments show that this is due to the change in the distribution of pressure over the aerofoil. These experiments are carried out be the method known as 'pressure plotting', in which a number of small holes in the aerofoils surface (*a, b, c, d,* etc.) are connected to a number of glass manometer tubes reservoir. Where there is suction on the aerofoil the liquid in the corresponding tubes is sucked up; where there is an increased pressure the liquid is depressed. This is really several U-tube manometer connected to a common reservoir. If results are to be recorded, it is more convenient to use pressure transducers coupled to a computer.

# Pressure distribution
---
![Pressure distribution over an aerofoil](../../Mechanical/Fluid%20Dynamics/Images/Pressure%20distribution%20over%20an%20aerofoil.jpg)
Figure shows the pressure distribution, obtained in this manner, over an aerofoil at an angle of attack of $4^o$. Two points are particularly noticeable

1. **The decrease in pressure on the upper surface is greater than the increase on the lower surface.**
2. **The pressure is not evenly distributed,** both the decreased pressure on the upper surface and the increased pressure on the lower surface being most marked over the front portion of the aerofoil.

The first shows that, although both surface, contribute, it is the **upper surface,** be means of its decreased pressure, which provides the greater part of the lift; at some angles as much as four-fifths.

The reason why the pressure distribution diagram of Figure has not been completed round the leading edge is because the changes of pressure are very sudden in this region. 

The increased pressure on the underside continues until we reach a point head-on into the wind where the air is brought to rest and the increase of pressure is $\frac{1}{2}\rho V^2$, or $q$ as recorded on pitot tube. The point at which this happens is called the **stagnation point**.

# Lift
---
Lift is the upward force generated by an aerofoil as it moves through a fluid. It's this force that allows airplanes to fly and sailboats to harness wind power. Here is the Breakdown.

According to Bernoulli's equation, when velocity at the upper surface is larger then the lower surface, the pressure difference between the upper and lower surface generates positive lift in the upward direction. However, a critical question is why air on the upper surface moves faster. Bernoulli's equation itself cannot provide and answer. A naive assumption is that two fluid particles that seperate at the leading edge of an airfoil have to meet again at the trailing edge, inferring higher velocity on the upper surface due to the longer travelling distance, but this assumption is not supported by the experimental facts. 

An alternative is that higher flow velocity on the upper surface could be achieved by compressing streamline tubes due to the so-called "obstacle effect" or the Venturi effect. When the corss section of streamline tube is pinched, local velocity is increased just like an incompressible flow in a flexible pipe. An interesting historical footnote is that this pipe-flow analogy was once adopted by the physicist Albert Einstein to design an airfoil called "cat's-back". However, how the compression process of streamline tube is related to the airfoil geometry is unknown.

The Bernoulli-based explanations imply that a velocity field is cause of the corresponding pressure field. It is conceptually questionable to assume that the velocity field comes first and the pressure field is established as a result. In fact, there is reciprocal cause-and-effect relationship between pressure and velocity. Therefore, the Bernoulli-based explanation is not complete and satisfactory.

# Types of Aerofoils
---
There are many types of aerofoils designed for specific purposes. Here, are few common ones:

- **Symmetrical airfoils:** Generate minimal lift but have low drag, useful for control surfaces like ailerons.
- **Cambered airfoils:** Generate more lift than drag, ideal for wings that need to generate lift for flight.
- **High-lift airfoils:** Have very curved surfaces for maximum lift at low speeds, used for take off and landing of airplanes.
## Applications:

Aerofoils are used in many applications such as:-
- Aircraft wings 
- Propellers
- Rotor blades
- Wind turbines
- Much more....
