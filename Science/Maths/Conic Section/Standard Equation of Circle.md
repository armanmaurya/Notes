The standard equation of a circle gives precise information about the center of the circle and its radius and therefore, it is much easier to read the center and the radius of the circle at a glance. The standard equation of a circle with **center** at ($h,k$) and **radius** $r$ is
$$
(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2
$$
Where, (x, y) is an arbitrary point on the circumference of the circle.

Consider this example of an equation of circle $(x-4)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 36$ is a circle centered at (4,2) with radius 6.
