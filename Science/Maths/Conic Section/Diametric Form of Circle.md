Let A ($x_{1},y_{1}$), B ($x_{2},y_{2}$) be the ends of the diameter of a circle. Let P ($x,y$) be any point on the circle.

The gradients (slopes),
$$
m_{AP} = \frac{y-y_{1}}{x-x_{1}}, \quad m_{BP} = \frac{y-y_{2}}{x-x_{2}}
$$
Since $\triangle APB$ is a right angle triangle,
$$
m_{AP} m_{BP} = \frac{y-y_{1}}{x-x_{1}}\times\frac{y-y_{2}}{x-x_{2}} =-1
$$
We get the equation of the circle,
$$
(x-x_{1})(x-x_{2}) + (y-y_{1})(y-y_{2}) = 0
$$
