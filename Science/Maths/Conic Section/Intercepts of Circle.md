Intercept made by a circle on the coordinate axes, is the distance between the 2 points where the circle cuts the x-axis and y-axis.
As the [General Equation of Circle](General%20Equation%20of%20Circle.md) is,
$$x^2 + y^2 + 2gx + 2fy +c =0$$
##### For x-intercept:- 
Put y = 0
$$x^2 + 2gx + c = 0$$
Let the root of above equation is $x_{1}, x_{2}$ then, 
$$x_{1}+x_{2} =-2g;\quad x_{1}x_{2}=c;$$
To find x-intercept formula is given by,
$$|x_{1}-x_{2}| = 2|\sqrt{ g^2-c }|$$
**Properties :-**
1. If $g^2-c > 0$ $\implies$ circle cuts the x-axis at 2 distinct points.
2. If $g^2-c=0$ $\implies$ Circle touches the x-axis.
3. If $g^2-c < 0$ $\implies$ Circle lies completely above or below the x-axis.

##### For y-intercept:-
Put x = 0,
$$y^2 + 2fy + c = 0$$
Let the root of above equation is $y_{1},y_{2}$ then,
$$y_{1} + y_{2} =-2f; \quad y_{1}y_{2} = c$$
To find y-intercept formula is given by,
$$|y_{1}-y_{2}| = 2|\sqrt{ f^2-c }|$$
**Properties:-**
1. If $f^2-c > 0$ $\implies$ circle cuts the y-axis at 2 distinct points
2. If $g^2-c = 0$ $\implies$ circle touches the y-axis.
3. If $g^2-c < 0$ $\implies$ circle lies completely either on right or left of y-axis.
