 General Equation of Circle is,
 $$
x^2 +y^2 + 2gx +2fy + c = 0
$$
Where, 
- $g,f,c$ are constant 
- ($-g,-f$) is center of circle
- $\text{radius} = \sqrt{ g^2 +f^2-c }$

---
**Note:-**
Always chase for Centre and radius to get the equation of circle

# Conditions:-
For a general equation of degree 2.
- Coefficient of $x^2$ = Coefficient of $y_{2}$ $\ne$ 0
- Coefficient of $xy$ = 0
- The general equation of circle $$x^2 + y_{2} + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0$$ contains 3 independent arbitrary constants $g,f$ and $c$ that a unique circle passes through 3 non-collinear points hence 3 points on a circle or 3 tangents to a circle or 2 tangent to a circle and a point etc. Must be given to determine the unique equation of the circle. (For a 3 non-collinear point you can find the equation of that circle which passes through those points)

## Proof:-
 On opening the [Standard Equation of Circle](Standard%20Equation%20of%20Circle.md) then equation we got is,
 $$x^2 + +y^2-2xh-2ky + h^2 + k^2- r^2 = 0$$
Let: $-h = g, -k =f,  h^2 +k^2-r^2 = c$, then general equation of circle is,
$$x^2 + y^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c =0$$
