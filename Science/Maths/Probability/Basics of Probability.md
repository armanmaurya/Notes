1. **Random Experiment:** experiment whose outcome is know.
2. **Sample Space:** Set of all possible outcomes. (denoted by "S")
3. **Event:** subset of sample space 
	1. **Simple Event:** Singleton set wali event
	2. **Mixed or Compound Events:** Event having more than one outcome.

**Three Types of Events:**
1. **Equality Likely Event**: having equal changes of occurrence. $$P(E_{1}) = P(E_{2})\implies E_{1}\  \& \ E_{2} \text{are Equally Likely}$$
2. **Mutually Exclusive/Disjoint/Incompatible Events:** Event whose simultaneous occurrence is impossible. $$E_{1}\cap E_{2}=\phi\implies E_{1} \ \& \  E_{2} \text{ are mutually Exclusive}$$
3. **Mutually Exhaustive Events:** Event whose union is Sample space. $$E_{1}\cup E_{2}=S\implies E_{1} \ \& \ E_{2} \text{ are mutually exhaustive}$$
