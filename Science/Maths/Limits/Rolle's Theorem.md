# Rolle's Theorem 
**Statement:** if a function $f(x)$ is
1. Continuous in the closed interval [a, b]
2. Differentiable in the open interval (a, b)
3. $f(x)$ = $f(b)$

	then there exists a point $c \ \epsilon (a, b)$ i.e $(a < c <b)$ such than $f'(c) = 0$

### Geometrical interpretation of Rolle's Theorem
If a curve is continues in the closed interval [a, b], the curve has a tangent at every point and $f(a)= f(b)$, then there exists at least one point $P(x=c)$ of the curve other than $x=a$ and $x=b$ the tangent at which is parallel to the x-axis, i.e., $f'(c)=0$

### Algebraic interpretation of Rolle's Theorem 
Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial in x and let the two roots of $f(x)=0$ be $x=a$ and $x=b$. Then according to Rolle's Theorem, at least one root of $f'(x)=0$ lies between $a$ and $b$
