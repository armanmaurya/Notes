Radians are alternate units used to measure angle in trigonometry. Just as it sounds, an radian is based on the radius of a circle. One **radian (rad)** is the angle created by bending the radius length around the arc of a circle. Because a radian is based on an actual part of circle rather than a arbitrary division, it is a much more natural unit of angle measures of upper level mathematics. 

What if we were to rotate all the way around the circle? Continuing to add radius lengths, we find it takes a little more than 6 of them to complete the rotation.

Recall from geometry that the arc length of complete rotation is the circumference, where the formula is equal to 2 $\pi$ times the length of the radius. 2 $\pi$ is approximately 6.28, so the circumference is a little more than 6 radius length. Or, in terms of radian measure, a complete rotation (360 degrees) is 2 $\pi$
$$
360 \text{ degree}=2\pi \text{ radians}
$$
With this as our starting point, we can find the radian measure of other angles.
