If u and v are two functions of $x$, then 
$$
\int (u.v) \, dx = u\left( \int v \, dx  \right)- \int \left( \frac{du}{dx} \right)\left( \int v \, dx  \right) \, dx  
$$
From the first letter of the words inverse circular, logarithmic, Algebraic, Trigonometric, Exponential functions, we get a word $ILATE$. Therefore the preference of selecting the $u$ function will be according to the order $ILATE$.
