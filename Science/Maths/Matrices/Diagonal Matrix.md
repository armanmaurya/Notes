A [Square Matrix](Square%20Matrix.md) in which all non-diagonal elements are zero is called a **diagonal matrix**.
Thus, $A = [a_{ij}]_{n\times n}$ is a diagonal matrix if $a_{ij} = 0$ for $i\ne j$.
For example, $A = \begin{bmatrix}2 & 0 & 0\\ 0 &-1 & 0 \\0& 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}$ is a diagonal matrix.
An n-rowed diagonal matrix is briefly written as diag. $[d_{1}, d_{2},\dots d_{n}]$, where $d_{1}, d_{2},\dots d_{n}$ are the diagonal elements. Thus, the above diagonal matrix A can be written as $\text{diag.}[2,-1, 0]$
