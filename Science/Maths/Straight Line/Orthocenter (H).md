# Orthocenter (H)
- Point of intersection of the three [Altitude](Altitude.md) (heights) of a triangle.
- Can be inside, on, or outside of the triangle.

### Find Orthocenter:
1. Find $Eq^n$ of two [Altitudes](Altitude.md) 
2. Solve then to get, say ($x=x_{1},y=y_{1}$)
3. Orthocenter is $(x_{1},y_{1})$

### Location:
- Acute Angle Triangle $\to$ $H$ lies inside.
- Obtuse Angle Triangle $\to$ $H$ lies outside.
- Right Angle Triangle $\to$ $H$ lies at right-angle
