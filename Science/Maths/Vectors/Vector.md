Vector is that quantity which is represented by arrow in Co-ordinate system which has both magnitude (length of vector) and direction.
Let's say we has vector $\vec{a}$ which has both magnitude | $\vec{a}$ | and direction 
## Vector between Two Points:
Let *A*, *B* are two points in a plane, To draw at vector 
- $\vec{AB} \rightarrow$ then arrow tail will be at *A* and head will be at *B*.
- $\vec{BA} \rightarrow$ then arrow tail will be at *B* and head will be at *A*.
- Distance between Point A and B is the magnitude of vector.
## Angle between Vectors:
- To Find the Angle, initial point of both vectors are at the same point.
- Then talk about vector
- Range of θ (angle between vectors) = [0, π]
