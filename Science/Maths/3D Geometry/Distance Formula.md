**In 2D:-**
The distance between two points A $(x_{1},y_{1},)$ and B ($x_{2}, y_{2}$) is given by
$$
AB = \sqrt{ [(x_{2}-x_{1})^2 + (y_{2}-y_{1})^2] }
$$
**In 3D:-**
The distance between two points A ($x_{1}$, $y_{1}$, $z_{1}$) and B ($x_{2}, y_{2}, z_{2}$) is given by
$$
AB = \sqrt{ [(x_{2}-x_{1})^2 + (y_{2}- y_{1})^2 + (z_{2}- z_{1})^2] }
$$
