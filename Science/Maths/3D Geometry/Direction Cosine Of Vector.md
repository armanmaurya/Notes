Let $\vec{a} = a_{1}i + a_{2}j + a_{3}k$ and $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are the angle made by $\vec{a}$ to positive x-axis, y-axis, z-axis respectively then $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are called direction angles of $\vec{a}$.
If we take cosine of angle ($\alpha, \beta, \gamma$), then these cosine of angle are called direction cosines.
$$
l = \cos \alpha = \frac{a_{1}}{|\vec{a}|}
$$
$$
m = \cos \beta = \frac{a_{2}}{|\vec{a}|}
$$
$$
n = \cos \gamma = \frac{a_{3}}{|\vec{a}|}
$$
And if we take sum of square of $l, m, n$ 
$$
l^2 + m^2 + n^2 = \frac{a_{1}^2 + a_{2}^2 + a_{3}^2}{|\vec{a}^2|}
$$
As we know than $|\vec{a}| = \sqrt{ a_{1}^2 + a_{2}^2 + a_{3}^2}$, then
$$
\boxed{l^2 + m^2 + n^2 = 1}
$$
Also,
$$
\begin{aligned}
\cos^2\alpha + \cos^2\beta + \cos^2 \gamma = 1 
\\
\sin^2\alpha + \sin^2\beta + \sin^2 \gamma = 2
\end{aligned}

$$
