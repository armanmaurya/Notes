# Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates have general formula, $C_{x}(H_{2}O)_{y}$, and were considered as hydrates of carbon from where the name carbohydrate was derived. But this is not completely true.

For example, the molecular formula of glucose $(C_{6}H_{12}O_{6})$ fits into this general formula, $C_{6}(H_{2}O)_{6}$. But all compounds which fits into this formula may not be classified as carbohydrates. Acetic acid $(CH_{3}COOH)$ fits into this general formula, $C_{2}(H_{2}O)_{2}$ but is not a carbohydrate.

Similarly, rhamnose, $C_{6}H_{12}O_{5}$ is carbohydrate but does not fit in this definition. A large number of their reactions have shown that they contain specific functional groups.

Chemically, the carbohydrates may be defined as optically active polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones or the compounds which produce such units on hydrolysis.

# Classification:-

#### 1 . Based on number of sugar units and behaviour towards hydrolysis

They are:
- Monosaccharides
- Oligosaccharides
- Polysaccharides
##### 1.1 Monosaccharides :-
These are simplest group of carbohydrates and are referred as simple sugars as they are sweet in taste. They cannot be further hydrolyzed to simpler compounds. They have the general formula $C_{n}(H_{2}O)_{n}$. Examples: Glucose and fructose.
Monosaccharides can be further classified into:
- Aldose in polyhydroxy aldehyde (glucose, galactose)
- Ketose is polyhydroxy ketone (fructose)

> Glucose is also called grape sugar or blood sugar; fructose is also called fruit sugar.

##### 1.2 Oligosaccharides 
These carbohydrates liberate two to ten monosaccharide molecules on hydrolysis. They are further classified as disaccharides, trisaccharides, tetrasaccharides, etc. Based on the number of monosaccharide units. For e.g., disaccharides like sucrose produce two molecules of monosaccharides on hydrolysis.
$$
\text{Sucrose} \xrightarrow{\text{Hydrolysis}} \text{glucose + fructose}
$$
A trisaccharides like raffinose on hydrolysis gives glucose, fructose and galactose.

##### 1.3 Polysaccharides 
This carbohydrates liberate a large number of monosaccharide molecules on hydrolysis. They are usually amorphous, insoluble in water and tasteless and are called non-sugars.

Examples: Starch, cellulose and glycogen

#### 2. Based on reducing or non-reducing sugars
Carbohydrates may also be classified as either reducing or non-reducing sugars.
###### 2.1 Reducing Sugar
All those carbohydrates which contains free aldehyde or ketonic group and reducing Fehling's solution and Tollen's regents reffered to as reducing sugars. All monosaccharides whether aldose or ketose are reducing sugars. Their functional groups are free. Examples: Maltose and lactose.

##### 2.2 Non Reducing Sugar
In disaccharides if the reducing group of monosaccharides i.e., aldehydic or ketonic groups are bonded, these are non-reducing sugars e.g., sucrose, while other in which these functional groups are free are reducing sugars. They don't reduce Felling or Tollent's reagent. 
Examples: Sucrose
