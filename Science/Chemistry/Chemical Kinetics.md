### Rate of Reaction
**Units:-**
$$
\begin{aligned}
rate &= mol\ letre^{-1} \sec^1 \\
&= Molarity \ \sec^1 
\end{aligned}
$$
Let's Say we Have equation:-
$$
H_{2} + I_{2}\to 2HI
$$
$$
Rate of Rx^n =-\frac{\Delta[H_{2}]}{\Delta t} =-\frac{\Delta [I_{2}]}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\Delta[HI]}{\Delta t}
$$
**Instantaneous Rate:**
$$
r_{inst} =-\frac{d[R]}{dt} = \frac{d[P]}{dt}
$$
## Rate Law

**Characteristic of Rate Constant:-**
- Larger the value of K, faster is the reaction.
- At a particular temperature, value of K is constant for a reaction.
- It is independent of initial concentration of reactants and products.

**Unit of Rate Constant:-**
$$
\text{Rate} = K[A]^x[B]^y
$$
$$
\text{Rate} = k(\text{concentration})^{x+y \ = \ n}
$$
So,
$$
K = mol^{1-n}litre^{n-1}sec^{-1}
$$
K ok what you want to me and this is good
