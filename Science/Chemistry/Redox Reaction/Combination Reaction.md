These [Redox Reaction](Jee/Chemistry/Redox%20Reaction/Redox%20Reaction.md) are the opposite of [Decomposition Reaction](Jee/Chemistry/Redox%20Reaction/Decomposition%20Reaction.md) and hence, involve the combination of two compounds to form a single compound in the form of A + B -> AB. For example,
- $H_{2} + Cl_{2}\to 2HCl + O_{2}\to CO_{2}$
- $4Fe + 3O_{2}\to 2Fe_{2}O_{3}$
