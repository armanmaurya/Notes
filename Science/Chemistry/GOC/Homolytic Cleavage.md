In this each part of the $\sigma$ bond takes one electron away, as shown below:

The electron pair separates evenly to each part, and as a result both products contain a single electron. The species that contains one or more single electron is called a radical. Radicals are produced from homolytic cleavage. 
Homolytic cleavage occurs mainly for non-polar bonds and heat or light is needed to provide enough energy to initiate the process For example:
