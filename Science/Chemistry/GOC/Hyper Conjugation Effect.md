Alkyl groups with at least one hydrogen atom on the $\alpha$ - carbon atom, attached to an unsaturated carbon atom ($H-C-C=C$ system), are able to release electrons by a mechanism similar to that of the electromeric effect. This process of transfer of electrons participating in a single bond into the adjacent p-orbitals is know as hyper conjugation.

The delocalization involves s and p orbitals (or p orbitals in case of free radicals). Thus it is also known as $s-p$ conjugation.
