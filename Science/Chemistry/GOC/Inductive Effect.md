Inductive effect may be defined as the permanent displacement of electrons forming a covalent bond towards the more electronegative element or group. The inductive effect is represented by the symbol $\to$, the arrow pointing towards the more electronegative element or group of element. This inductive effect is divided into two types depending on their strength of electron withdrawing or electron releasing tendency with respect to hydrogen.

**Positive Inductive Effect:-**

If an atom or group attracts electrons less strongly than hydrogen, it is said to have $+I$ effect (electron-repelling or electron-releasing). As the number of alkyl groups attached to carbon increases, the positive inductive effect increases.
Positive Inductive effect in decreasing order is,
$$
(CH_{3})_{3}C > (CH_{3})_{2}H > CH_{3}CH_{2}CH_{2} > CH_{3} >H
$$

**Negative Inductive Effect:-**

Any atom or group attracting electrons more strongly than hydrogen is said to have a $-I$ effect (electron-attracting or electron-withdrawing). 
Negative inductive effect in decreasing order is,
$$
NO_{2}>CN>F>COOH>Cl>Br>I>CF_{3}>OH>OCH_{3}>C_{6}H_{5}>H
$$
