The hydrogen spectrum appears when the electron of the hydrogen atom jumps from a higher energy level to a lower energy level. These two states are differentiated by $n$ (higher energy state) and $n'$ (lower energy state). The intensity of emitted light particles or photons directly depend on the difference in the two energy levels.
## Emission Series
The hydrogen atom emits light due to the transition of electron between two energy levels. The different wavelengths of the emission spectrum are calculated using Emission Formula.

**Emission Series are classified into different series:-**
1. **Lyman Series**:-
It is the series of emitted light if the transition occurs between the first and any other energy level.
2. **Balmer Series:-**
It is the series of transitions between the second and other energy level.
3. **Paschen Series:-**
It is the transition between the third and any other energy level.
4. **Bracket Series:-**
It is the transition between the fourth and any other energy state.


### Emission Formula 
The hydrogen spectrum contains many different spectral lines. These lines have different wavelengths. To calculate the wavelengths of these lines formula is given by:
$$
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R\left( \frac{1}{n_{1}^2}-\frac{1}{n_{2}^2} \right)
$$
Where:
- $R$ = Rydberg's constant
- $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ is the whole numbers

The value of $n_{1}$ is constant. Whereas, $n_{2}$ can adopt different values for a particular series.
