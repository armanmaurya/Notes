The hydrogen spectrum appears when the electron of the hydrogen atom jumps from a higher energy level to a lower energy level. These two states are differentiated by $n$ (higher energy state) and $n'$ (lower energy state). The intensity of emitted light particles or photons directly depend on the difference in the two energy levels.
## Emission Series
The hydrogen atom emits light due to the transition of electron between two energy levels. The different wavelengths of the emission spectrum are calculated using Emission Formula.

**Emission Series are classified into different series:-**
1. **Lyman Series**:-
   It is the series of emitted light if the transition occurs between the first and any other energy level.
2. **Balmer Series:-**
   It is the series of transitions between the second and other energy level.
3. **Paschen Series:-**
   It is the transition between the third and any other energy level.
4. **Bracket Series:-**
   It is the transition between the fourth and any other energy state.
### Emission Formula 
The hydrogen spectrum contains many different spectral lines. These lines have different wavelengths. To calculate the wavelengths of these lines **Rydberg formula** is used:
$$
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R\left( \frac{1}{n_{1}^2}-\frac{1}{n_{2}^2} \right)
$$
Where:
- λ = Wavelength of the emitted light
- $R$ = **Rydberg constant** $(1.097×10^7 m^{-1}$)
- $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ ​are integers representing the principal quantum numbers of the initial and final energy levels, with $n_{2}$ > $n_{1}$.

The value of $n_{1}$ is constant. Whereas, $n_{2}$ can adopt different values for a particular series.

#### Example:
For the **Balmer series**, which occurs when electrons fall to $n_1 = 2$ (visible spectrum), let's calculate the wavelength of light emitted when an electron transitions from $n_2 = 3$ to $n_1 = 2$:
$$\frac{1}{\lambda} = 1.097 \times 10^7 \left ( \frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{3^2} \right)$$


$$
\frac{1}{\lambda} = 1.097 \times 10^7 \left ( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{9} \right)
$$

$$
\frac{1}{\lambda} = 1.097 \times 10^7 \times \left ( \frac{5}{36} \right)
$$

$$
\frac{1}{\lambda} = 1.524 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}^{-1}
$$

$$
\lambda = \frac{1}{1.524 \times 10^6} = 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} = 656 \, \text{nm}
$$

So, the wavelength of the emitted light is 656 nm, which corresponds to the red part of the visible spectrum.
