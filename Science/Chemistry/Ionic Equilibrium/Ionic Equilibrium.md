In weak electrolytes, equilibrium is established between ions and the unionized molecules. This type of equilibrium involving ions in aqueous solution is called ionic equilibrium.
$$CH_{3}COOH_{(aq.)} \rightleftharpoons CH_{3}COO^- + H^+$$
In this example since $CH_{3}COOH$ is weak electrolyte it ionizes almost 10% and ionic equilibrium is established between ionized and unionized molecule.
