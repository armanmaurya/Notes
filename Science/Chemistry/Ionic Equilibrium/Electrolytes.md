Electrolytes are those substance which conducts electricity in molten state or aqueous state are called Electrolytes

**Why Electrolytes Conduct Electricity?**
Because of the movement of ions (cations or anions)

Two types of Electrolytes are:-
1. Strong Electrolytes
2. Weak Electrolytes

### Strong Electrolytes
- Electrolytes which dissociate or ionized completely in water
- Degree of dissociation is very high
- These electrolytes have high electrical conductivity 
- Strong Acid, Strong Base and Salts Examples of Strong Electrolytes
### Weak Electrolytes
- Electrolytes which do not dissociate or ionized completely in water
- Degree of dissociation is very low.
- These electrolytes have low electrical conductivity.
- Weak Acids, Weak Base are Examples of Weak Electrolytes
