Electrolysis is a process in which [Non-Spontaneous](Jee/Chemistry/Electrochemistry/Non-Spontaneous%20Reaction.md)  [Redox Reaction](Jee/Chemistry/Redox%20Reaction/Redox%20Reaction.md) is carried out at the Expense of Electrical Energy.
During Electrolysis electron lost during [Oxidation](Jee/Chemistry/Electrochemistry/Oxidation.md) is Equal to electron gain during [Reduction](Jee/Chemistry/Electrochemistry/Reduction.md).
