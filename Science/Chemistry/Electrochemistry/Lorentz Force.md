The Lorentz force is the force experienced by a charged particle moving through an electromagnetic field. The formula is given by:
$$
\vec{F}_{net} = q\vec{E} + q(\vec{v} \times \vec{B})
$$
Or 
$$
\vec{F}_{net} = \text{Electric Force + Magnetic force}
$$
Where:
- $q$ is the charge on the particle 
- $\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the particle 
- $\vec{E}$ is the Electric field vector
- $\vec{M}$ is the Magnetic field vector
