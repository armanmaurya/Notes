Species having same molecular formula but different structural formula or Arrangement in space is called isomers.
# Type of Isomerism:-
1. Structural Isomerism (M.F = Same, S.F = Different)
2. Stereo Isomerism (M.F = Same, S.F = Same, Arrangement in 3 D space = Different)
### 1 Structural Isomerism:-
Generally There are 4 Type of Structural Isomers are-
1. Ionization Isomers ^818fbc
2. Hydration Isomers 
3. Linkage Isomers 
4. Co-ordination Isomers 
#### 1.1 Ionization Isomers:-
- Molecular Formula = Same
- Structural Formula = Different (Reason -> Counter ion different)

**Counter ion different means:-** Pani me ionize karke different ion milega. 
Ex:- 
Let take Simple formula - $[Co(NH_{3})_{5}Cl]Br_{2}$ || Counter ion = $Br^-$
Let take Ionization Isomer of above - $[Co(NH_{3})_{5}Br]ClBr$ || Counter ion = $Br^- \& Cl^-$

As you can see above both example Have Same Molecular Formula, but in the isomer we get two different ions.
#### 1.2 Hydration Isomers:-
- Molecular Formula = Same
- No. Of water of crystallization = different 

**Ex:-**
1. Let's take $$[Co(NH_{3})_{4}(H_{2}O)_{2}]Cl_{3}.H_{2}O$$ And Let's take Hydration Isomer of above formula $$[Co(NH_{3})_{4}(H_{2}O)Cl]Cl_{2}.2H_{2}O$$ As you can see they both have number of water crystallization different.

**Question**
Find no. Of hydration isomers possible for $[Co(H_{2}O)_{6}]Cl_{3}$ ?
**Solution**
Now lets make hydration isomers for the compound, but keep in mind that coordination number does not change.
$$
[Co(H_{2}O)_{5}Cl]Cl_{2}H_{2}O
$$
$$
[Co(H_{2}O)_{4}Cl_{2}]Cl.2H_{2}O
$$
Keep in mind that water of crystallization ($H_{2}O$) is stable outside only if, when minimum one counter ion (in this case it is $Cl$) is present outside the []. And if no counter ion the water of crystallization is not stable, so below case will not be considered as Isomers.
$$
[Co(H_{2}O)_{3}Cl_{3}]3H_{2}O
$$
So, Correct answer is 2 Isomers.
#### 1.3 Linkage Isomers 
It is show when ambidentate ligand are present.

---
**Question**
Find no. Of Linkage isomers possible for $[Co(CN)_{2}Cl_{2}]^{-2}$ ?
**Solution**
First write all ambidentate ligand present in compound
**In this case**- $CN$, $NC$, $Cl$ are the ambidentate ligands
- $Cl$ is 2 not need to worry about $Cl$.
- Play with P&C of $CN, NC$.

Let's Calculate:
When, $CN\to 0$ $NC\to 2$, $CN\to 1$ $NC\to 1$, $CN\to 2$ $NC\to 0$
Then there is 3 Isomers.
> If asked only isomers instead of Linkage isomers, then we will not count $[Co(CN)_{2}Cl_{2}]^{-2}$ then the answer will be 2 isomers.

> If Total isomers is asked then the answer should be 3.

As you can see above method is length as the No. Of ligand increases the complexity of Question increases.
So, **Below is the Shortcut method to find the Total Isomers.**
$$
\text{Total Isomers} = (n_{1}+1)(n_{2}+1)(n_{3}+1)\dots
$$
Where,
$n_{1}$ = No. Of first type of ambidentate ligand.
$n_{2}$ = No. Of Second type of ambidentate ligand.

You can see [[Linkage Isomerism Ques|this question]]  to see how to use the shortcut method.

#### 1.4 Co-ordination Isomers
- Only applicable when both cation & anion are complex.
- We exchange ligand from anionic part and cationic part.

**Ex:-**
Let's say we have complex $[Pt(NH_{3})_{4}][PtCl_{4}]$, Find the Number of Isomers.
**Solution**:-
