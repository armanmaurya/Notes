# Crystal Field Theory

According to C.F.T electrostatic attraction force work b/w ligand and metal ion (ionic interaction)

Anionic ligand treated as -ve point charge and neutral or cationic ligand treated as dipole. 

5-d orbital in an isolated gaseous metal atom/ion have same energy i.e. These are degenerated orbital (equal energy).

Degeneracy is removed when these orbitals came in contact with ligands degeneracy removed.

### Crystal Field Splitting energy ($\Delta_{o}$)
The crystal field splitting energy ($\Delta_{o}$) is proportional to the electrostatics interactions b/w the metal ion and the ligand.
This interaction is affected by the size (ionic radius)  of CMA as well as of the ligands. So, Smaller the ionic radius is larger the interaction.
