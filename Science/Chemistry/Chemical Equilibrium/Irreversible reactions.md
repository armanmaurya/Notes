- Proceed in only one direction, forward direction.
- Uni-direction chemical reactions.
- Concentration of reactants will be zero after the completion reaction.
- Take finite time to get completed.
- Equilibrium is not defined for these types of reactions.

**Examples:-**
1. Gaseous Reaction in Open container $$N_{2}(g) + 3H_{2}(g)\to 2NH_{3}(g)$$
2. Ionisation of Strong Acid and Strong Base:- $$HCL\to H^+ + CL^-$$ $$NaOH\to Na^++OH^-k$$
3. Neutralisation of Strong Acid + Strong Base:- $$HCL + NaOH\to NaCl + H_{2}O$$
