The tendency to give $e^-$ pair to an electron deficient carbon atom by forming covalent bond is defined as nucleophilicity. 
$$
Nu^- + CH_{3}-X\to Nu-CH_{3} + X^-
$$
Where:
- $Nu^-$ is the nucleophile 

**(i) Factor affecting Nucleophilicity :**
1. The factors which increases $e^-$ density to donor atom increase nucleophilicity. As if nucleophile is attached to donor atom which are donating electron to nucleophile then the nucleophilicity of nucleophile is increases. For example :
$$
O^-H < C_{2}H_{5}O^-
$$
The nucleophilicity of $OH^-$ is less than $C_{2}H_{5}O^-$ because $C_{2}H_{5}$ is donating electron to $O$ which increases nucleophilicity.
2. The more polarisable donor atom is better nucleophile. Therefore, large size of donor (nucleophile) atom increases nucleophilicity. For example :
$$
O^-H < S^-H
$$
Here, nucleophilicity of $OH^-$ is less than $SH^-$ because of size of $S$ is greater than $O$ or $S$ is more polarisable than $O$. 
3. **Periodicity**:- 
In Period, nucleophilicity decreases from left to right due to decrease in size of donor atom
$$
CH_{3}^- > NH_{2}^- > OH^- > F^-
$$
In Group, nucleophilicity increases from top to bottom due to increases in size of donor atom, but basicity decreases from top to bottom.
**Acid Strength** : $HI > HBr > HCl > HF$
**Basic Strength** : $F^- > Cl^- > Br^- > I^-$
**Nucleophilicity** : $F^- < Cl^- < Br^- < I^-$
