# Force:-
The force experienced by a charged particle moving in a [Magnetic Field](../Physics/Magnetic%20Field.md) can be determined using the [Lorentz Force](../Chemistry/Electrochemistry/Lorentz%20Force.md) equation. The formula is given by:
$$
\vec{F} = q(\vec{v} \times \vec{B})
$$
Where:
- $\vec{F}$ is the magnetic force on the charge.
- $q$ is the charge of the particle.
- $\vec{v}$ is the velocity vector of the particle 
- $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field vector
- $\theta$ is the angle between velocity vector and magnetic field vector

To find only magnitude force ($F$). The formula is given by:
$$
F = qvB\sin \theta = qv_{\perp}B = qvB_{\perp}
$$
The direction of the force ($\vec{F}$) is perpendicular to both the velocity ($\vec{v}$) and the magnetic field ($\vec{B}$) vectors, following the right-hand rule.

# Motion:-
When charge is moving in with velocity $v$ then two cases are formed :
1. Velocity is Parallel to Magnetic Field
2. Velocity is Perpendicular to Magnetic Field

#### 1. Velocity is Parallel to Magnetic Field:-
If velocity of [Electric Charge](../Physics/Electrostatics/Electric%20Charge.md) particle is parallel (along or opposite) to the [Magnetic Field](../Physics/Magnetic%20Field.md) then as you can observe above formula of force value of $\sin \theta$ is zero, So value of force exerts on the charged particle is zero.
$$
F= 0
$$
#### 2. Velocity is Perpendicular to Magnetic Field:-
As per the above formula of force value of $\sin \theta$ is 1. So value of force exerts on the charged particle is given by:
$$
F = qvB
$$
Where:
- $q$ is the charge on the particle 
- $v$ is the velocity of particle 
- $B$ is the magnitude of Magnetic field

**Radius:-**
Particle will follow the circular path with force (F) acting as a centripetal force. The radius of this circular path is given by:
$$
R = \frac{mv}{Bq} = \frac{P}{Bq} = \frac{\sqrt{ 2m(K.E) }}{Bq}
$$
Where:
- $m$ is the mass of particle 
- $P$ is the momentum of particle 
- K.E is the kinetic energy of particle 

**Time Period:-**
Time period of the particle in circular path is given by:
$$
T = \frac{2\pi R}{v} = \frac{2\pi(m)}{Bq}
$$
As you can notice that time period is independent of velocity of charge. So, it doesn't matter what is the velocity of particle it will complete is motion in same time period.

Also, frequency is independent of velocity :
$$
f = \frac{1}{T}
$$
