The magnetic moment ($\vec{m}$) of a current-carrying loop is a vector quantity that characterizes the strength and orientation of the [Magnetic Field](Physics/Magnetic%20Field.md) produced by the loop. For a planar loop carrying [Electric Current](Physics/Current/Electric%20Current.md) $I$, the magnetic moment is given by,

$$\vec{m} = I \cdot \vec{A}$$

Where:
- $\vec{m}$ is the magnetic moment vector,
- $I$ is the current flowing through the loop,
- $\vec{A}$ is the vector representing the area of the loop (with direction normal to the plane of the loop).

The magnitude of the magnetic moment is given by $|\vec{m}| = I.A$, where $A$ is the magnitude of the area vector.

The direction of the magnetic moment is determined by the right-hand rule: if you curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the current flow in the loop, and your thumb points in the direction of the area vector then, 
- If fingers curls clockwise-> ⨂ 
- if fingers curls in Anti-clockwise-> ⦿
