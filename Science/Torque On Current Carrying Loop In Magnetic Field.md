 The torque ($\vec{\tau}$) experienced by a current-carrying loop in a [Magnetic Field](../Physics/Magnetic%20Field.md) is the rotational force acting on the loop. The torque is given by the formula : 
 $$
\vec{\tau} = \vec{m} \times \vec{B}
$$
Where: 
- $\vec{\tau}$ is the torque vector
- $\vec{m}$ is the [magnetic moment vector of the current-carrying loop](Magnetic%20Moment%20Of%20Current%20Carrying%20Loop.md) 
- $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field vector

The magnitude of the torque ($|\vec{\tau}|$) is given by:
$$
|\vec{\tau}| = m.B.\sin (\theta)
$$
Where:
- $\theta$ is the angle between the magnetic moment vector $\vec{m}$ and the magnetic field vector $\vec{B}$.

Magnetic field ($\vec{B}$) tries to align current-carrying loop in a plane $\perp$ to $\vec{B}$.

The direction of the torque is determined by the right-hand rule. If you point your fingers of the right hand in the direction of the [Magnetic Moment](Magnetic%20Moment%20Of%20Current%20Carrying%20Loop.md) ($\vec{m}$) and then curl you fingers toward the direction of the magnetic field ($\vec{B}$), you thumb will point in the direction of the torque ($\vec{\tau}$).
