The force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field is determined by the interaction between the magnetic field and the moving charges (current) in the wire. The formula for the magnetic force (Fâƒ—F) on a straight current-carrying wire is given by the following expression:
$$
\vec{F} = I.(\vec{L} \times \vec{B})
$$
Where:
- $I$ is the current flowing through the wire
- $\vec{L}$ is the vector representing the length of the wire (in the direction of current flow)
- $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field vector
