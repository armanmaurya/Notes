The force on a current-carrying wire in a [Magnetic Field](Physics/Magnetic%20Field.md) determined by the interaction between the [Magnetic Field](Physics/Magnetic%20Field.md) and the moving charges ([Current](Physics/Current/Current.md)) in the wire. The formula for the magnetic force (Fâƒ—) on a straight current-carrying wire is given by the following expression:
$$
\vec{F} = I.(\vec{L} \times \vec{B})
$$
Where:
- $I$ is the current flowing through the wire
- $\vec{L}$ is the vector representing the length of the wire (in the direction of current flow)
- $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field vector
