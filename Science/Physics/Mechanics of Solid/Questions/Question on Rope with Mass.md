**Question**
A Rope of Mass (M), Length (L), Young's Modules (Y) and Area (A) is hung on vertically on the fixed plane, then find the Net Elongation ($\Delta l$) in Rope.

***Solution***:-
As we have Know that the tension in Massless string is Same along its length. And we can find the Elongation by using the Hook's law
$$
\frac{T}{A} = Y \frac{\Delta l}{l}
$$
But In this case there is a Rope that has mass, Tension (T) is different along its length, As the Tension (T) is different Stress is different, As Stress is different Strain is different. So, we have to use integration so find the Net Elongation.

**Steps To Find Elongation**
**Step-1**: 
Take a Small Element $dx$ at $x$ from bottom, And Consider the Elongation $dz$ of that $dx$ element.
**Step-2:**
Show the tension force on $dx$ elements As you have studied in NLM Tension = Latka hua mass $\times$ g.
$$\text{Mass of length (L)} = M $$
$$
\text{Mass of x length} = \frac{M}{L}x
$$
$$
T = \frac{M}{L}xg
$$
**Step-3**:
Apply Hook's law on that $dx$ Element
$$
\frac{F}{A} = Y \frac{\Delta l}{l}
$$
$$
\frac{\frac{M}{L}xg}{A} = Y \frac{dz}{dx}
$$
After Re-arranging
$$
\int_{0}^L \frac{mxg}{LAY} \, dx = \int  \, dz  = \Delta l
$$
$$
\Delta l = \frac{mg}{LAY}. \frac{L^2}{2} = \frac{mgL}{2AY}
$$
$$
\Large\boxed{\Delta l = \frac{mgL}{2AY}}
$$
