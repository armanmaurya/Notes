# Momentum of EM Waves
When EM Wave interacts with matter, momentum of one photon is given by :
$$
P = \frac{h}{\lambda} = \frac{E}{c}
$$
Where:
- $P$ = momentum of one photon
- $h$ = plank's constant 
- $\lambda$ = wavelength of light

**There are two cases:-**
1. When photons are completely absorbed 
2. When protons are completely reflected

### 1. When Photons Are Completely Absorbed 
---
When photons are bombarded on a plane and it absorbs all the photons completely then,
Initial Momentum:-
$$
P_{i} = \frac{h}{\lambda}= \frac{E}{c}
$$
Final Momentum:-
$$
P_{f} = 0
$$
And force is equal to change in momentum divided by time,
$$
F = \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta t}
$$
**Then**, Force due to one photon,
$$
F = \frac{P_{f}-P_{i}}{t} = \frac{\frac{E}{c}}{t} = \frac{E}{t.c}
$$
Force due to all photons,
$$
F = \frac{E_{total}}{t.c} = \frac{\text{Power}}{c} = \frac{I.A}{c}
$$
And Radiation Pressure is given be :
$$
\text{Radiation Pressure} = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{\text{Power}}{A.c}
$$
As $\frac{\text{Power}}{A}$ is know is Intensity $I$, so, 
$$
\text{Radiation Pressure} = \frac{I}{c}
$$
##### Summary :-
$$
\text{Force due to all photons} = \frac{I.A}{c}
$$
$$
\text{Radiation Pressure} = \frac{I}{c}
$$
### 2. When photons are completely reflected
---
When photons are bombarded on a plane and it reflects all the photons completely then,
Initial Momentum:-
$$
P_{i} = \frac{h}{c} = \frac{E}{c}
$$
Final Momentum:-
$$
P_{f} =-\frac{h}{\lambda} =-\frac{E}{c} 
$$
And force is equal to change in momentum divided by time,
$$
F = \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta t}
$$
**Then**, Force due to one photon,
$$
F = \frac{P_{f}-P_{i}}{t} = \frac{\frac{2E}{c}}{t} = \frac{2E}{t.c}
$$
Force due to all photons,
$$
F = \frac{2E_{total}}{t.c} = \frac{2\text{Power}}{c} = \frac{2I.A}{c}
$$
And Radiation Pressure is given be :
$$
\text{Radiation Pressure} = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{\text{2Power}}{A.c}
$$
As $\frac{\text{Power}}{A}$ is know is Intensity $I$, so, 
$$
\text{Radiation Pressure} = \frac{2I}{c}
$$
##### Summary :-
$$
\text{Force due to all photons} = \frac{2I.A}{c}
$$
$$
\text{Radiation Pressure} = \frac{2I}{c}
