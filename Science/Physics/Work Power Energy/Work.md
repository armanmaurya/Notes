When a force F is applied to body of mass M and point of action of force is displaced by displacement $ds$ in the direction of force and angle between force F and displacement $d$ is $\theta$ then work done is,
$$
\text{Work} = F.ds = Fds\cos \theta
$$
It is a [Scalar Quantities](../../Maths/Vectors/Scalar%20Quantities.md).
- **Unit:-** SI=Joules, CGS: erg.  [1J = $10^7$ erg]
- **Dimension:** $[ML^2T^{-2}]$

Work can be positive, negative and zero.
