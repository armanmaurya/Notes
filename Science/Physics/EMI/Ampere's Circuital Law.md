The circulation of magnetic field along a closed loop is $\mu_{o}$ times the total current passing through normally, of the area of the closed loop.
$$
\int \vec{B}. \, \vec{dl} = \mu_{o}I_{\text{enclosed}}
$$
This law is analogous to Gauss Law.

**Important Points:-**
- The direction of circulation is assumed to be positive and accordingly any current in the direction of circulation will be positive and the other negative.
- If the current is at an angle $\theta$ with the plane of the loop, then take its two components, one parallel to the loop, and the other perpendicular to the loop. Consider only the normal component in the formula.
- The above form of Ampere's Law is not valid when the electric field through the area of loop is not constant.
