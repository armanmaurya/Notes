It is the rate of change of [Angular Displacement](Jee/Physics/Circular%20Motion/Angular%20Variable/Angular%20Displacement.md) with respect to time. Angular velocity is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction, and it is typically denoted by the symbol $\omega$ (omega).

Mathematically, angular velocity (ω) is defined as the ratio of the change in angular displacement (Δθ) to the corresponding change in time (Δt):
$$
\omega = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}
$$
The SI unit for angular velocity is radians per second (rad/s).
# Relation With Linear Velocity
---

Angular velocity is related to linear velocity ($v$) by the formula:
$$
\large v = \omega.r
$$
where:
- v is the linear velocity,
- ω is the angular velocity, and
- r is the distance from the axis of rotation to the point of interest (radius).
