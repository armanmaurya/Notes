The rate of change of angular velocity and is denoted by the symbol α (alpha). Angular acceleration is a vector quantity.

Mathematically, angular acceleration (α) is defined as the ratio of the change in [Angular Velocity](Angular%20Velocity.md)  (Δω) to the corresponding change in time (Δt):
$$
\alpha = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t}
$$
The SI unit for angular acceleration is radians per second squared (rad/s²)

If the angular acceleration is constant, the object is said to have uniform angular acceleration.
If the angular acceleration is zero, the object is said to be in constant [Angular Velocity](Angular%20Velocity.md).
