Angular position is a measure of the location of a point in a circular path relative to a reference point or axis. angular position is often used to describe the orientation of an object. The reference point or axis is usually defined as the starting point for measuring the angle.
The angular position (Î¸) can be calculated using the formula:
$$
\Theta = \frac{s}{r}
$$
Where, $\large s$ = arc length, $\large r$ = radius of circle
