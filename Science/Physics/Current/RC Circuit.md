A **resistor-capacitor circuit (RC Circuit)** is an electrical circuit consisting of passive components like resistors and capacitors, driven by the current source or the voltage source.
The capacitor stores energy, and the resistor connected to the circuit controls the rate of charging or discharging.

The charging and discharging of the capacitor is not an instant process but takes some time. If the resistor and capacitor are connected in series, the capacitor charges gradually through the resistor until the voltage across the resistor is equal to the supply voltage.
## Charging of Capacitor
Let us consider that a fully discharged capacitor is connected to the circuit. 

**Switch is Open:**
The initial condition of the circuit is: 
- time (t) = 0 
- [Charge](Jee/Physics/Electrostatics/Charge.md)  (q) = 0 
-  [current](Current.md)  (i) = 0. 

**Switch is Closed:**
The initial condition of the circuit:
- The time will start from t = 0
- [Current](Current.md) starts flowing through the capacitor and resistor.
- Charge start to increase exponentially in capacitor because of resistor.

The final condition of the circuit:
- Time (t) = t
- [Charge](Jee/Physics/Electrostatics/Charge.md) (q) = maximum
- [current](Current.md) (i) = Almost zero
