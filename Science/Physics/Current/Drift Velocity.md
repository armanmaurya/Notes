 The average velocity attained by [charged particle](../Electrostatics/Charge.md), (eg. Electron) in a material due to an electric field.
 We can use the following formula in order to calculate drift velocity:
 $$
V_{drift} = \frac{eE}{m}\tau
$$
Where, 
$\Large\tau$ = [Average Relaxation time](Jee/Physics/Current/Average%20Relaxation%20time.md)
