Batteries  can be connected in two basic types of combinations. These combinations make up the foundation for all other combinations. These two combinations are: 

1. Series Combination
2. Parallel Combination.

## Series Combination 

Two cells are given which are connected in series with each other. In this case, one terminal of each cell is connected to the other one, and the other terminal is free in either of the cells. $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ are the emf’s of two cells and $r_{1}$, $r_{2}$ are their internal resistances.

To replace this series combination of cells with a single equivalent cell of emf value Eeq and req. Then, 
$$E_{eq}- Ir_{eq}= E_{1} + E_{2}- (Ir_{1} + Ir_{2})$$
Thus, $E_{eq} = E_{1} +E_{2}$ and $r_{eq} = r_{1}+r_{2}$

This can be extended to any number of cells, $E_{eq}=E_{1}+E_{2}+\dots$ and $r_{eq}=r_{1}+r_{2}+\dots$ 

In case, connected the negative electrode of the battery are connected to the positive electrode of another battery. In case we connect their similar electrodes together, the two emf’s will now point in opposite directions. In that case, the equivalent values will be, 
$$E=E_{1}-E_{2}+\dots \text{ and } r_{eq}=r_{1}+r_{2}+\dots$$ 

## Parallel Combination:
In this combination cells are connected in parallel. $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ are the emf's of two cells and $r_{1}$, $r_{2}$ are their internal resistances. This time, the current flowing through each cell is different and they are denoted by $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ while the total current flowing through the circuit is denoted by $I$ and is the sum of both of the two currents.

Equivalent cell of emf value $E_{eq}$ and $r_{eq}$. Then, $$\frac{E_{eq}}{r_{eq}} = \frac{E_{1}}{r_{1}} + \frac{E_{2}}{r_{2}}$$
