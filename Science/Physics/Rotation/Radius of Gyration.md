# Radius of Gyration
The body of Continuous mass system of mass $M$ has a MOI $I$, then if we concentrate this whole mass $M$ to a point mass and At what distance (k) did we place it point mass to get the same MOI As we are getting when it is in continues mass system is called **Radius of Gyration**.  
$$
I = mk^2
$$
Where:
- $m$ is the mass of body
- $k$ is the radius of gyration 
- $I$ is the [Moment of Inertia](Moment%20of%20Inertia.md) of that continues body

K has no meaning without axis of rotation 
K is a scalar quantity.

The radius of gyration increases with the increase in distance between the particles of the body and the axis of rotation.
The radius of gyration decreases with the decreases in distance between the particles of the body and the axis of rotation.
