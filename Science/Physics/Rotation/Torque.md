# Torque
It is the rotational analogue of force and expresses the tendency of a force applied to an object to cause rotation in it about a given point, It is a [Vector Quantity](../../Maths/Vectors/Vector%20Quantities.md). Formula is given by,
$$
\vec{\tau} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F} = r \ F\sin \theta
$$
Where:
- $\tau$ is torque generated 
- $\vec{r}$ is the Displacement (radius) [vector](../../Maths/Vectors/Vector.md) between the Point of Application of Force and the axis
- $\vec{F}$ is the force vector from point of application of **force along the axis of rotation**.
- $\theta$ is the angle between radius [vector](../../Maths/Vectors/Vector.md) ($\vec{r}$) and Force [vector](../../Maths/Vectors/Vector.md) ($\vec{F}$)

**Condition for Minimum Torque:-**

$$
\theta = 0\degree, \pi \quad | \quad r = 0
$$
$$
\tau_{min} = 0
$$
**Condition of Maximum Torque:-**
$$
\theta = 90\degree, \frac{\pi}{2}
$$
$$
\tau_{max} = r \ F
$$
# Torque and Angular Momentum
Rate of Change of [Angular Momentum](Angular%20Momentum.md) with respect to time is called [Torque](Torque.md).
$$
\vec{\tau}_{ext} = \frac{d\vec{L}}{dt}
$$

Relation between torque, [Moment of Inertia](Moment%20of%20Inertia.md), [Angular Acceleration](../Circular%20Motion/Angular%20Variable/Angular%20Acceleration.md) is given by, 
$$
\tau = I\alpha
$$
