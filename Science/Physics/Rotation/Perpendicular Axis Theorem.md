# Perpendicular Axis Theorem
For a planar object, the [Moment of Inertia](Moment%20of%20Inertia.md) about an axis perpendicular to the plane is the sum of the [Moment of Inertia](Moment%20of%20Inertia.md) of two perpendicular axes through the same point in the plane of the object.

Let's say the body is existing in x-y plane and we know the MOI of that body about x-axis and y-axis and we want to calculate the MOI about z-axis which perpendicular to the plane of body then,
$$
I_{z} = I_{x} +I_{y}
$$
>Only Applicable for Planar Objects.
