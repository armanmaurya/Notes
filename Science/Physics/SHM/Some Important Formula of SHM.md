1. Displacement in SHM at any instant is given by
$$
y = a \sin \omega t
$$
$$
\text{or}
$$
$$
y = a\cos \omega t
$$
2. Velocity of a particle executing SHM at any instant is given by $$
v = \omega \sqrt{ (a^2-y^2) }
$$ At mean position y = 0 and v is maximum.$$
v_{max} = a\omega
$$ At extreme position y = a and v is zero.
3. Acceleration of a particle executing SHM at any instant is given by 
$$
\text{A or } \alpha = \omega ^2y
$$
Negative sign indicates that the direction of acceleration is opposite to the direction in which displacement increases, i.e., towards mean position.
At mean position y = 0 and acceleration is also zero.
At extreme position y = a and acceleration is maximum 
$$
A_{max} =-a\omega^2
$$
