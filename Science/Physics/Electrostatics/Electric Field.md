We know that if you have a single positively charged particle, a positively charged particle will be pushed away from it by the [Electric Force](Electric%20Force.md).

The electric field is a “force field” around a charged object that illustrates the direction the electric force would push an imaginary positively charged particle if there was one there. It also shows us how hard a push the electric force would give. We don’t have to actually place a positively charged particle near the charged object to find out what the electric field would be, we just have to know what would happen if we did. Once we’ve used the imaginary positive charge to find the electric field, we can use the electric field to determine how any other charged particles would move around the charged object.

Imagine we have a sphere that is negatively charged. The electric field would show that an imaginary positively charged particle is pulled towards the sphere by the electric force. The electric field would always point towards the sphere, because we always use an imaginary positively charged particle to determine the electric field. As we move away from the sphere, the electric field gets weaker and weaker.

Now say we have two flat plates with a space between them. The left one is positively charged and the right-hand one is negatively charged.

The electric field between the plates is going to be strong, because we not only have a negatively charged plate pulling our imaginary positive particle (that we use to measure the electric field, remember) to the right, we also have a positively charged plate pushing it to the right. The plates are working together to make the imaginary particle move toward the right.
