Electric charge is a physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electric filed.
- Charge can neither be created nor destroyed.
- Unit of charge is Coulomb

Charges are of two types-
1. Positive Charge (+)
2. Negative Charge (-)

When there is Equal amount of Positive Charge and Negative Charge then body is said to be **neutral** 
## Properties of Charge
- Charge is always associated with mass means, there is no charge without mass
- Charge is Scalar 

## Conversion of Charge
The total charge in an isolated system never changes. By *isolated* we mean that no matter is allowed to cross the boundary of the system. We could let light pass into or out of the system, since the "particles" of light, called *photons*, carry no charge at all. Within the system charged particles may vanish or reappear, but they always do so in pairs of equal and opposite charge. For instance, a thin-walled box in a vacuum exposed to gamma rays might become the scene of a "pair-creation" event in which a high-energy photon ends its existence with the creation of an electron and a positron. Two electrically charged particles have been newly created, but the net change in total charge, in and on the box, is zero, An event that *would* violate the law we have just stated would be the creation of a positively charged particle *without* the simultaneous creation of a negative charged particle. Such an occurrence has never been observed.
Of course, if the electric charges of an electron and a positron were not precisely equal in magnitude, pair creation would still violate the strict law of charge conservation. The equality is a manifestation of the particle -- antiparticle duality already mentioned, a universal symmetry of nature.
On thing will become clear in the course of out study of electromagnetism : non-conservation of charge would be quite incompatible with the structure of our present electromagnetic theory. We may therefore state, either as a postulate of the theory or as an empirical law supported without exception by all observations so far, the charge conversation law :

The total electric charge in an isolated system, that is, the algebraic sum of the positive and negative charge present at any time, never changes.
Sooner or later we must ask whether this law meets the test of relativistic invariance. We shall postpone until Chapter 5 a thorough discussion of this important question. But the answer is that it does, and not merely in the sense that the statement above holds in any given inertial frame, but in the stronger sense that observers in different frames, measuring the charge, obtain the same number. In other words, the total electric charge of an isolated system is a relativistically invariant number.

## Invariancy of charge
As we move with speed of light mass, volume, length, etc. Changes but [Charge](Jee/Physics/Electrostatics/Charge.md) remain same for the body, it doesn't matter what the speed of the body charge will always be same.

## Quantization of Charge
 Quantization of [charge](Jee/Physics/Electrostatics/Charge.md) implies that [charge](Jee/Physics/Electrostatics/Charge.md) can assume only certain discrete values. That is to say the observed value of electric charge (q) of a particle will be integral multiples of (e) 1.6×10−19 coulombs. 
i.e.
$$
q = ne
$$
Where, n=0,1,2,.... (both positive and negative integers)  
The charge cannot assume any value between the integers.

## Transferring of Charge
As we know that +ve [Charge](Jee/Physics/Electrostatics/Charge.md)  don't move from their place, but -ve [Charge](Jee/Physics/Electrostatics/Charge.md) that we also know as electron it can move, so if we extract electron from body its mass will reduce slightly because electron have mass making the body positive and if we give electron to body its mass will increase slightly making the boy negative.
