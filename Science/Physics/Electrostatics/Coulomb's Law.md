Applicable for point [Charge](Jee/Physics/Electrostatics/Charge.md) only.

Let $q_{1}$ & $q_{2}$ be two point charge separated by distance $r$, then these point charge exert force on each other if they are like charges then they repel and if they are unlike charges then they attract. To calculate that force we need coulomb's law :-
$$
F= \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{o}} \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^2}
$$
Where,
$\Large\epsilon$ = permittivity of free space

**This force is dependent on-**
- Distance between charges
- Medium between charges
