Ridge regression, also known as Tikhonov regularization, is a technique used in [Linear Regression](Linear%20Regression.md) to address the problem of multicollinearity among predictor variables. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated, which can lead to unreliable and unstable estimates of regression coefficients.

****Ridge regression is a procedure for eliminating the bias of coefficients and reducing the [Mean Squared Error](Mean%20Squared%20Error.md) by shrinking the coefficients of a model towards zero in order to solve problems of overfitting or multicollinearity that are normally associated with ordinary least squares regression.***
