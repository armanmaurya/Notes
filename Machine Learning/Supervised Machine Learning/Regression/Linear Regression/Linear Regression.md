Linear regression is type [Regression](../Regression.md) algorithm that computer the linear relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent features by **fitting a linear equation to observed data.**
## Types of Linear Regression
There are two main types of linear regression:
1. [Simple Linear Regression](Simple%20Linear%20Regression.md)
	- Involves only one independent variable and one dependent variable.
2. [Multiple Linear Regression](Multiple%20Linear%20Regression.md)
	- Involves more than one independent variable and one dependent variable.

## Loss Functions in Linear Regression
A variety of loss functions can be used to determine the strength of any linear regression model. The most common measurements are:
1. [Mean Squared Error](Mean%20Squared%20Error.md)
	- Calculates the average of the squared difference between the actual and predicted values for all the data points.
2. [Mean Absolute Error](Mean%20Absolute%20Error.md)
	- Calculates then average absolute difference between the predicted values and actual values.
