Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is a form of [Linear Regression](Linear%20Regression.md) used to model the relationship between one dependent variable $(Y)$ and two or more independent variables $(X_{1}, X_{2},\dots,X_{n})$.
## Equation
$$
Y= \beta_{o} + \beta_{1}X_{1}+\beta_{2}X_{2}+\dots+\beta _{n}X_{n}
$$
Where, 
- $Y$: Dependent variable (response)
- $X_{1},X_{2},\dots,X_{n}:$ Independent variables (predictors)
- $\beta_{o}$: Intercept
- $\beta_{1},\beta_{2},\dots,\beta_{n}$: Coefficients (modal parameters)
