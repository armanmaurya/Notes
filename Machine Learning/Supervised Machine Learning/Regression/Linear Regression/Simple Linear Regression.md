This is the simplest form of linear Regression, and it involves only one independent variable and one dependent variable. This equation for simple linear regression is:
$$
y = mx +c
$$
Where, 
- $y$ is the dependent variable
- $x$ is the independent variable 
- $m$ is the slope
- $c$ is the intercept
