Logistic Regression is used for [Binary Classification](../Binary%20Classification.md) where we use **sigmoid function**, that takes input as independent variables and produces a probability value between 0 and 1.

For example, we have two classes **Class 0** and **Class 1**, if the value of logistic regression is greater than 0.5 (threshold value) then it belongs to **Class 1** otherwise it belongs to **Class 0**. It is referred to as regression because it is the extension of [Linear Regression](../../Regression/Linear%20Regression/Linear%20Regression.md) but is mainly used for classification problems.

**Key Points**
- Logistic regression predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable. 
- It can either **Yes** or **No**, **0** or **1**, **true** or **false**, but instead of giving the exact value as 0 and 1, it gives the probabilistic values which lie between 0 and 1.
## Types of Logistic Regression
On the basisof the categories, Logistic Regression can be classified into three types:
1. **Binomial:** There can be only two possible types of the dependent variable, either 0 or 1.
2. **Multinomial:** There can be 3 or more possible unordered types of dependent variables, such as "cat", "dog", or "sheep".
