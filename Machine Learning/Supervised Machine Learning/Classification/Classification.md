- Classification is a type of [Supervised Machine Learning](Supervised%20Machine%20Learning.md) technique.
- It is process of categorical data or objects into predefined classes or categories based on their features or attributes.

For Example, a classification model might be trained on a dataset of images labeled on either dogs or cats and then used to predict the class of new, unseen images of dogs or cats based on their features such as color, texture, and shape.
## Types of Classification
There are different types of classification in machine learning are :-
1. **[Binary Classification](Binary%20Classification.md)**
This classification type goal is to sort the data into **two distinct categories**
2. Multiclass Classification
This classification type goal is to sort data into **more than two categories**
1. Multi-Label Classification
Unlike multi-class classification where each data point belongs to only one class, multi-label classification allows data points to belong to multiple classes. A movie recommendation system could tag a movie as both action and comedy.
## Classification Algorithms
1. **Linear Classifiers:** models creates a linear decision boundary between classes. They are simple and computationally efficient. Linear classifications models are as follows:
	- [Logistic Regression](Logistic%20Regression/Logistic%20Regression.md)
