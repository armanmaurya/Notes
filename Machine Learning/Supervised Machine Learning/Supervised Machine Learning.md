It Involves training a model using labeled data, where each input comes with a corresponding correct output. Over time, it adjusts itself to minimize errors and improve accuracy. The process is like a teacher guiding a student hence the term "supervised" learning. 

## Working of Supervised Machine Learning
Where **supervised learning algorithm** consists of input features and corresponding output labels. The process works through:
- **Training Data**: The model is provided with a training dataset that includes input data (features) and corresponding output data (labels or target variables).
- **Learning Process**: The algorithm process the training data, learning the relationship between the input features and the output labels. This is achieved by adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual labels.

After training, the model is evaluated using a **test dataset** to measure its accuracy and performance. Then the model's performance is optimized by adjusting parameters and using techniques like **cross-validation** to balance bias and variance. 

> ***In summary, supervised machine learning involves training a model on labeled data to learn patterns and relationships, which it then uses to make accurate predictions on new data.***
### Types of Supervised Learning 
Supervised Learning can be applied to two main types of problems:
- [Classification](Classification/Classification.md) :- Where the output is a categorical variable
  E.g., Span vs Non-Spam Emails, Yes Vs No.
 - [Regression](Regression/Regression.md) :- Where the output is a continuous variable.
   E.g., Predicting house prices, stock prices.
