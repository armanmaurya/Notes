Variance measures the dispersion of a dataset, indicating how much the values differ from the mean. It is the average of the squared difference from the mean.
## Formula
For a dataset with n values $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3},\dots x_{n}$ the valiance $\sigma^2$ is given by:
$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_{i}- \mu)^2
$$
Where, 
- $n$ is the number of observations.
- $x_{i}$ is the $i^{th}$ observation.
- $\mu$ is the mean.


> [!example] Example
> For the dataset {4, 8, 6, 5, 3, 7} with mean = 5.5
> $$\sigma^2 = \frac{(4-5.5)^2 + (8- 5.5)^2 + (6-5.5)^2+(5-5.5)^2+(3-5.5)^2 +(7-5.5)^2}{6}$$ 
> $$\sigma^2 = \frac{17.5}{6} = 2.92$$
