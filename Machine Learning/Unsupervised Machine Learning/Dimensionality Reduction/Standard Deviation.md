Standard deviation is the square root of the [variance](Variance.md), providing a measure of the spread of the dataset in the same units as the data.
## Formula
For the dataset with $n$ values $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3},\dots,x_{n}$ the mean $\sigma$ is given by:
$$
\sigma = \sqrt{ \sigma^2 } = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_{i}-\mu)^2 }
$$

> [!example] Example
> For the dataset {4, 8, 6, 5, 3, 7}, with [Variance](Variance.md) $\sigma^2=2.92$. 
> $$\sigma=1.71$$
