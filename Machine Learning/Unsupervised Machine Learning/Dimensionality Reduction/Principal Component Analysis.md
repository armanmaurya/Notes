It is a technique for [Dimensionality Reduction](Dimensionality%20Reduction.md) that identifies a set of orthogonal axes, used to map data in a higher dimensional space to data lower dimension space, while keeping the most important information patterns or relationships between the variables without any prior knowledge of the target variables, by finding new set of variables, smaller than the original set of variables.
- It is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation that converts a set of correlated variables to a set of uncorrelated variables. It is the most widely used tool in exploratory data analysis and in machine learning for predictive models.
- It is an [Unsupervised Machine Learning](../Unsupervised%20Machine%20Learning.md) technique used to examine the interrelations among a set of variables. It is also known as a general factor analysis where [Regression](../../Supervised%20Machine%20Learning/Regression/Regression.md) determines a line of best fit.
