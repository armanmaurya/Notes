Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features in a dataset while preserving as much information as possible.
### Types of Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms
- [Principal Component Analysis](Principal%20Component%20Analysis.md) :- Reduces dimensions by transforming data into uncorrelated principal components.
- [Linear Discriminant Analysis](Linear%20Discriminant%20Analysis.md) :- Reduces dimensions while maximizing class separability for classification tasks.
- [Non-Negative Matrix Factorization](Non-Negative%20Matrix%20Factorization.md) :- Breaks data into non-negative parts to simplify representation.
- [Locally Linear Embedding](Locally%20Linear%20Embedding.md) :- Reduces dimensions while preserving the relationship between nearby points
