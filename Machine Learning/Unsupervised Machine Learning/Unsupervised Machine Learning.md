Unsupervised machine learning analyzes and clusters unlabeled datasets using [Machine Learning](Machine%20Learning.md) algorithms. These algorithms find hidden patterns and data without any human intervention, i.e., we donâ€™t give output to our model. The training model has only input parameter values and discovers the groups or patterns on its own.
## Working
Unsupervised learning works by analyzing unlabeled data to identify patterns and relationships.
The data is not labeled with any predefined categories or outcomes, so the algorithm must find these patterns and relationships on its own.

The Input to the unsupervised learning models is as follows:
- **Unstructured data:** May contain noisy (meaningless) data, missing values, or unknown data
- **Unlabeled data**: Data only contains a value for input parameters, there is no targeted value (output). It is easy to collect as compared to the labeled one in the Supervised approach.
## Types
There are mainly 3 types of algorithms which are used for Unsupervised dataset.
- [Clustering Algorithms](Clustering%20Alogrithms/Clustering%20Algorithms.md)
- [Association Rule Learning](Association%20Rule%20Learning/Association%20Rule%20Learning.md)  
- [Dimensionality Reduction](Dimensionality%20Reduction/Dimensionality%20Reduction.md)
