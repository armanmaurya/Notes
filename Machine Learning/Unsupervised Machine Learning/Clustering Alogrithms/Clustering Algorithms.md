Clustering in unsupervised machine learning is the process of grouping unlabeled data into clusters based on their similarities. The goal of clustering is to identify patterns and relationships in the data without any prior knowledge of the data's meaning. 
### Types of Clustering Algorithms
- [K-Means Clustering](K-Means%20Clustering.md) :- Groups data into $K$ clusters based on how close the points are to each other.
- [Hierarchical Clustering](Hierarchical%20Clustering) :- Creates clusters by building a tree step-by-step, either merging or splitting groups.
- [Density-Based Clustering](Density-Based%20Clustering.md) :- Finds clusters in dense areas and treats scattered points as noise.
- [Mean-Shift Clustering](Mean-Shift%20Clustering.md) :- Discovers clusters by moving points toward the most crowded areas.
- [Spectral Clustering](Spectral%20Clustering.md) :- Groups data by analyzing connections between points using graphs.
